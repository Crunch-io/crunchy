Catalog
~~~~~~~

``/sources/``

A Shoji Catalog representing the Sources added by this User. POST a
multipart form here, with an "uploaded\_file" field containing the file
to upload; 201 indicates success, and the returned Location header
refers to the new Source resource.

The uploaded sources will use the file's filename as their .name
attribute and will have blank description.

The catalog will include the sources' .name and .description

Alternately, you may POST a urlencoded payload with a ``source_url``
parameter that points to a publicly accessible URL. Both "http" and the
"s3" scheme are supported. This endpoint will then download such file
synchronously and verify that it is a valid source file. It will be made
available for the current user sources catalog.

Regular Shoji POST payloads are also supported to create new sources
from remote source URLs. A ``location`` attribute should be included in
the Shoji:entity body POSTed.

"body" which the client intends to update. 204 indicates success.
