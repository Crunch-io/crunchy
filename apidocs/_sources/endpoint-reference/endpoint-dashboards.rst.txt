Dashboards
----------

A dashboard is a deck that has been configured to be displayed in presentation
mode by default. They can be accessed directly by a client URL where only
the Deck ID is made available.

This endpoint works as a helper to obtain a direct reference to the deck without
necessarily knowing under which Dataset is located.

Catalog
~~~~~~~


``/dasboards/``

Returns an empty ``shoji:catalog`` by default. It should be used to discover
available dashboards that have been shared with you directly.

GET

.. language_specific::

   .. code:: json

      {
          "element": "shoji:catalog",

      GET /dashboards/?id=abcdef

   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {
          "element": "shoji:catalog",
          "self": "https://app.crunch.io/api/dashboards/",
          "index": {
            "../datasets/123/decks/abcdef/": {
                "dashboard": {
                    "name": "Dashboard name",
                },
                "name": "Deck configured for client",
                "creation_time": "1986-11-26T12:05:00",
                "id": "4fa25",
                "is_public": false,
                "owner_id": "https://app.crunch.io/api/users/abcd3/",
                "owner_name": "Real Person",
                "team": null
            }
          }
      }

The dashboards that are available for searching are any of those that the
user has view access to. These are the decks that are either public or
shared through a team on any on the datasets the authenticated user has at least
view permissions on.
