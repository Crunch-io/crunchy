Progress
--------

Progress resources provide information about the current state of a
long-running server process in Crunch. Some requests at certain
endpoints may return 202 status containing a progress URL in the body,
at which one can monitor the progress of the request that was accepted
and not yet completed.

GET
^^^

.. language_specific::
   --HTTP
   .. code:: http

      GET /progress/{id}/ HTTP/1.1

      {
          "element": "shoji:view",
          "self": "https:/app.crunch.io/api/progress/{id}/",
          "value": {
              "progress": 22,
              "message": "exported 2 variables"
          }
      }


``GET`` on a Progress view returns a Shoji View containing information
about the status of the indicated process. The "progress" attribute
contains a integer between -1 and 100. Positive progress values indicate
that the job is being processed, while a negative value indicates that
an error occurred in processing. Zero entails that the job has not been
started, while 100 indicated completion. Additionally, if the ``id``
from the request URL does not exist, ``GET`` will nevertheless return
200 status and indicate ``"progress": 100``.

Optionally, the View will provide a message regarding current status.

You must be authenticated to ``GET`` this resource.
