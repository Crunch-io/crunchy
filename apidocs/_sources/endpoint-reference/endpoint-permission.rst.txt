Permissions
-----------

Authorization to view, edit, and manage a dataset is controlled by the
dataset's permissions catalog:

``/datasets/{id}/permissions/``

The permissions catalog is a Shoji Catalog that collects (not contains)
Users. There are no permission "entities" to retrieve, create, or
delete: all action is achieved directly on the permissions catalog.

GET Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {
          "element": "shoji:catalog",
          "self": "https://app.crunch.io/api/datasets/1/permissions/",
          "description": "Lists all the users that have access to this dataset",
          "index": {
              "https://app.crunch.io/api/users/42/": {
                  "dataset_permissions": {
                      "edit": true,
                      "change_permissions": true,
                      "view": true
                  },
                  "is_owner": true,
                  "name": "Lauren Ipsum",
                  "email": "lipsum@crunch.io"
              }
          }
      }


If authorized to view the dataset, a successful GET returns a Shoji
Catalog indicating the users who have access to this dataset and their
respective permissions. This includes the current, authorized user
making the request. Index tuples are keyed by User URL.

Tuple values include:

======================= =========== ===========================================
Name                    Type        Description
======================= =========== ===========================================
name                    string      Display name of the user
----------------------- ----------- -------------------------------------------
email                   string      Email address of the user
----------------------- ----------- -------------------------------------------
is_owner                boolean     Whether this user is the dataset's "owner"
----------------------- ----------- -------------------------------------------
dataset_permissions     object      Attributes governing the user's
                                    authorization; see below
======================= =========== ===========================================

Supported ``dataset_permissions``, all boolean, are:

-  **view**: Whether the user can view the dataset. Note that "viewing"
   is not limited to just GET requests, for dataset viewers may create
   filters, private variables, and saved analyses, for example.
-  **edit**: Whether the user can edit the dataset. When editing, users
   with this permission may modify the common data of a dataset,
   including things like public filters available to all viewers of the
   dataset.
-  **change\_permissions**: Whether the user may alter other users'
   authorization on this dataset, i.e., PATCH tuples for users that
   already exist on the catalog.

PATCH Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PATCH verb is used to make all modifications to dataset
authorization: modifying existing permissions, revoking permissions for
users with access, and granting access to users.

Modify existing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change the permissions a user has, PATCH new dataset\_permissions,
like:

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {
          "https://app.crunch.io/api/users/42/": {
              "dataset_permissions": {
                  "edit": false,
                  "view": true
              }
          },
          "send_notification": true,
          "dataset_url": "https://app.crunch.io/dataset/1"
       }


Only the "dataset\_permissions" key in the tuple can be modified by
PATCHing this catalog. Other keys, such as "name", are included only for
facilitating human-readable display of the catalog. If sent, these other
keys will be ignored. To modify users' names, see users.

If a subset of dataset\_permissions are included in the payload, only
the specified permissions will have their values updated. Omitted
permissions will remain unchanged.

Multiple users' permissions can be modified in a single request by
including multiple tuples keyed by User URL.

The "send\_notification" key in the payload is optional; if included and
True, the server will send an email invitation to all newly added users
(see below), as well as to users who are granted "edit" privileges.

If "send\_notification" is included and true, you may also include a
"dataset\_url", which is the URL that will be included in the email
notifying the users that they now have access to the dataset. The web
application will send the "browse" view URL, for example, so that when
the user receives the email notification, the link they follow will take
them to the relevant dataset. If "send\_notification" is true and
"dataset\_url" is omitted, the email link will default to
https://app.crunch.io/.

Add new user from within account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a user (i.e. share with them), there are two cases. First, if the
user to be added is a member of the current user's account, PATCH
similar to above, using this user's URL as key:

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {
          "/users/id/": {
              "dataset_permissions": {
                  "edit": false,
                  "view": true
              },
              "profile": {
                  "weight": null,
                  "applied_filters": []

              }
          }
      }


This payload may include a "profile" member, which are initial values
with which to populate the sharee's user-dataset-profile.

Valid "profile" members include:

-  **weight**: a URL to one of the dataset's weight variables; if
   omitted, the sharer's current weight variable will be used
-  **applied\_filters**: an array of filter URLs which are shared with
   all dataset viewers. If any of the specified filters are private, the
   PATCH request will return 400 status. Default value for
   "applied\_filters" is [].

If the "profile" member is not included, the newly shared users will be
created with their user dataset preferences matching the sharer's
current weight.

Revoking access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To revoke users' access to this dataset (aka "unshare" with them), PATCH
a null tuple for their user URLs:

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {
          "/users/id/": null
      }


Note that all of these PATCHes for add/edit/remove access to the dataset
can be done in a single request that combines them all.

Validation
^^^^^^^^^^

The server will insist, and clients should also validate, that

-  There is one and only one user with edit: true privileges for a
   dataset; if not, the PATCH request will return 400.
-  The users who are receiving new authorization via PATCH must have
   corresponding dataset\_permissions on their account authorization.
   For example, the user who is updated to have edit: true has a
   dataset\_permission of edit: true on their account authorization. If
   not, the PATCH request will return 400.
-  The user that is PATCHing this catalog must have share: true for this
   dataset; if not, the PATCH request will return 403.

.. _inviting-new-users:

Inviting new users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to share a dataset with people that are not users of
Crunch yet. To do so, it is necessary to send in an email address
instead of a user URL as a sharing key.

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {
          "somebody@email.com": {
              "dataset_permissions": {
                  "edit": false,
                  "view": true
              },
              "profile": {
                  "weight": null,
                  "applied_filters": []
              }
          },
          "send_notifications": true,
          "url_base": "https://app.crunch.io/password/change/${token}/",
          "dataset_url": "https://app.crunch.io/dataset/1/"
      }


A new user with such email address will be created and added to the
account of the user that is making the request. The new user will
receive an invitation email to Crunch.io with an activation link. In
case the user exists on other or the same account, no changes to the
user will be made.

If "send\_notification" was included and true in the request, the user
will receive a notification email informing her about the new shared
dataset if requested so. New users, unless they have an OAuth provider
specified, will need to set a password, and the client application
should send a URL template that directs them to a place where they can
set that password. To do so, include a "url\_base" attribute in the
payload, a URL template with a ``${token}`` variable into which the
server will insert the password-setting token. For the Crunch web
application, this template is
``https://app.crunch.io/password/change/${token}/``.

.. note::

    You may not know whether the email address you're sharing with already has a Crunch account. To be safe, you can always include "url_base" whenever you include `"send_notifications": true`. If it's needed, your invitees will thank you. If it's not needed, it will be ignored.

.. note::

    If you share with a new user and don't include `"send_notifications": true`, they won't receive an email inviting them to set a password for their new Crunch account. That's okay, though: they can always go to the web application and click "Forgot password" to send a new password reset token.
