Users

Catalog
~~~~~~~

``/users/{?email,id}``

A successful GET on this resource returns a Shoji Catalog whose "index"
URL's refer to User objects. If the "email" or "id" parameters are
provided, the result is narrowed to Users matching those parameters.

This method only supports GET requests. To add users they need to be
added from each account users' catalog. This endpoint ensures that the
new users belong to an account and get an invitation accordingly.

Entity
~~~~~~

``/users/{id}/{?reason_url}``

A Shoji Entity with the following body members:

-  name
-  id
-  email
-  id\_method (optional)
-  id\_provider (optional, and only if id\_method == 'oauth')

The id\_method member can be one of {'oauth', 'pwhash'}. If not present,
'pwhash' is assumed.

The authenticated user can only access another user's entity endpoint IF
any of the following are true:

-  Both belong to the same account
-  They are both members of a common team
-  Authenticated user is account admin and viewed user is collaborator
   on such account

A user themselves or with "alter\_users" account permission can PUT new
attributes via a JSON-like request body. A 200 indicates success.

Send invitation email
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``/users/{id}/invite/``

A POST to this resource sends an invitation from the current user to the
identified User. A 204 indicates success. The current user must have
"can\_alter\_users" account permission or 403 is returned instead.

If a "url\_base" parameter is included in the request body, it will be
used to form links inside the invitation.

Change password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``/users/{id}/password/``

A POST on this resource must consist of a JSON object with the members
"old\_pw" and "new\_pw". A 204 indicates success, a 400 indicates
failure.

Reset user's password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``/users/{id}/password_reset/``

A GET on this resource always returns 204. A POST will send a reset
password notification to the identified user. A 204 indicates success.

If a "url\_base" parameter is included in the request body, it will be
used to form links inside the notification.

Change user's email
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``/users/{id}/change_email/``

A POST on this resource must consist of a JSON object with the members
"pw" and "email". A 204 indicates potential success to change the users
email address to the newly provided email. The user should check their
email and verify they own the email address in question.

If the password does not match the users current password they will
receive an error message (400 Bad Request). If the user is an oauth
account, then the email address may not be changed (409 Conflict).

If the user ID does not match the current signed in user, an 403
Forbidden will be sent back.

Expropriate a user
''''''''''''''''''

An account admin can expropriate a user from the same account. This will
change ownership of all of the affected user's teams, projects and
datasets to a new owner.

The new owner must also be part of the same account and should have
``create_datasets`` permissions set to ``true``.

``POST /users/{id}/expropriate/``

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {
        "element": "shoji:entity",
        "body": {
          "owner": "http://app.crunch.io/api/users/123abc/"
        }
      }


The new owner provided can be a user URL or a user email. ##### User

              }
          }
      }


The tuples contain information of the type of access the user has to
each dataset via the ``access_type`` attribute. It includes:

-  The list of teams that provide access to this dataset
-  The project that provides access to this dataset or null
-  If the user has a direct share to this dataset

The ``permissions`` attribute indicates the final coalesced permissions
this user enjoys on the given dataset.
