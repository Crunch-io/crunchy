Password policy
---------------

Crunch has a simple policy for acceptable passwords:

-  It must be 8 characters or longer
-  It must contain at least 4 unique characters

Examples:

-  Secure 8 character password: ``4B3a8f4$``
-  Secure passphrase: ``correct horse battery staple``

We highly recommend that users use long pass phrases instead of
passwords for security and for ease of remembering the credentials for
accessing the service.
