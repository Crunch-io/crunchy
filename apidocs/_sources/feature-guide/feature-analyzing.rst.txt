Multidimensional analysis
-------------------------

In the Crunch system, any analysis is also referred to as a "cube".
Cubes are the mechanical means of representing analyses to and from the
Crunch system; you can think of them as spreadsheets that might have
other than two dimensions. A cube consists of two primary parts:
"dimensions" which supply the cube axes, and "measures" which populate
the cells. Although both the request and response include dimensions and
measures, it is important to distinguish between them. The request
supplies expressions for each, while the response has data (and
metadata) for each. The request declares what variables to use and what
to do with them, while the response includes and describes the results.
See Object Reference:Cube for complete details.

Dimensions
~~~~~~~~~~

Each dimension of an analysis can be simply one variable, a function
over it, a traversal of its subvariables (for array variables), or even
a combination of multiple variables (e.g. A + B). Any expression you can
use in a "select" command can be used as a dimension. The big difference
is that the system will consider the distinct values rather than all
values of the result. Variables which are already "categorical" or
"enumerated" will simply use their "categories" or "elements" as the
extent. Other variables form their extents from their distinct values.

For example, if "3ffd45" is a categorical variable with three categories
(one of which is "No Data": -1), then the following dimension
expressions:

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {
          "dimensions": [
              {"variable": "datasets/ab8832/variables/3ffd45/"},
              {"function": "+", "args": [{"variable": "datasets/ab8832/variables/2098f1/"}, {"value": 5}]}
          ]
      }


...would form a result cube with two dimensions: one using the
categories of variable "3ffd45", and one using the distinct values of
(variable "2098f1" + 5). If variable "2098f1" has the distinct values
[5, 15, 25, 35], then we would obtain a cube with the following extents:

+------+-----+-----+------+
|      | 1   | 2   | -1   |
+======+=====+=====+======+
| 5    |     |     |      |
+------+-----+-----+------+
| 15   |     |     |      |
+------+-----+-----+------+
| 25   |     |     |      |
+------+-----+-----+------+
| 35   |     |     |      |
+------+-----+-----+------+

Each dimension used in a cube query needs to be reduced to distinct
values. For categorical or enumerated variables, we only need to refer
to the variable, and the system will automatically use the "categories"
or "elements" metadata to determine the distinct values. For other
types, the default is to scan the variable's data to find the unique
values present and use those. Often, however, we want a more
sophisticated approach: numeric variables, for example, are usually more
useful when binned into a handful of ranges, like "0 to 10, 10 to 20,
...90 to 100" rather than 100 distinct points (or many more when dealing
with non-integers). The available dimensioning functions vary from type
to type; the most common are:

-  categorical: {"variable": url}
-  text: {"variable": url}
-  numeric: Group the distinct values into a smaller number of bins via:
-  {"function": "bin", "args": [{"variable": url}]}
-  datetime: Roll up seconds into hours, days into months, or any other
   grouping via:
-  {"function": "rollup", "args": [{"variable": url}, {"value":
   variable.rollup\_resolution}]}
-  categorical\_array:
-  One dimension for the subvariables: {"each": url}
-  One dimension for the categories: {"variable": url}
-  multiple response:
-  One dimension for the subvariables: {"each": url}
-  One dimension for the selected-ness, which means transforming the
   array from a set of arbitrary categories to a standard "selected" set
   of categories (1, 0, -1) via:

   -  {"function": "selections", "args": [{"variable": url}]}

Measures
~~~~~~~~

A set of named functions to populate each cell of the cube. You can
request multiple functions over the same dimensions (such as
“cube\_mean” and “cube\_stddev”) or more commonly just one (like
“cube\_count”). For example:

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {"measures": {"count": {"function": "cube_count", "args": []}}}


or:

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {"measures": {
          "mean": {"function": "cube_mean", "args": [{"variable": "datasets/1/variables/3"}]},
          "stddev": {"function": "cube_stddev", "args": [{"variable": "datasets/1/variables/3/"}]}
      }}


When applied to the dimensions we defined above, this second example
might fill the table thusly for the "mean" measure:

+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| mean   | 1      | 2      | -1     |
+========+========+========+========+
| 5      | 4.3    | 12.3   | 8.1    |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| 15     | 13.1   | 0.0    | 9.2    |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| 25     | 72.4   | 4.2    | 55.5   |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| 35     | 8.9    | 9.1    | 0.4    |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+

...and produce a similar one for the "stddev" measure. You can think of
multiple measures as producing "overlays" over the same dimensions.
However, the actual output format (in JSON) is more compact in that the
dimensions are not repeated; see Object Reference:Cube output for
details.

ZCL expressions are composable. If you need, for example, to find the
mean of a categorical variable's "numeric\_value" attributes, cast the
variable to the "numeric" type class before including it as the cube
argument:

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {"measures": {
          "mean": {
              "function": "cube_mean",
              "args": [{
                  "function": "cast",
                  "args": [
                      {"variable": "datasets/1/variables/3"},
                      {"class": "numeric"}
                  ]
              }]
          }
      }}


Comparisons
~~~~~~~~~~~

Occasionally, it is useful to compare analyses from different sources. A
common example is to define "benchmarks" for a given analysis, so that
you can quickly compare an analysis to an established target. These are,
in effect, one analysis laid over another in such a way that at least
one of their dimensions lines up (and typically, using the same
measures). These are also therefore defined in terms of cubes: one set
which defines the base analyses, and another which defines the overlay.

For example, if we have an analysis over two categorical variables
"88dd88" and "ee4455":

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {
          "dimensions": [
              {"variable": "../variables/88dd88/"},
              {"variable": "../variables/ee4455/"}
          ],
          "measures": {"count": {"function": "cube_count", "args": []}}
      }


then we might obtain a cube with the following output:

+-----+------+------+------+
|     | 1    | 2    | -1   |
+=====+======+======+======+
| 1   | 15   | 12   | 9    |
+-----+------+------+------+
| 2   | 72   | 8    | 3    |
+-----+------+------+------+
| 3   | 23   | 4    | 17   |
+-----+------+------+------+

Let's say we then want to overlay a comparison showing benchmarks for
88dd88 as follows:

+-----+------+------+------+--------------+
|     | 1    | 2    | -1   | benchmarks   |
+=====+======+======+======+==============+
| 1   | 15   | 12   | 9    | 20           |
+-----+------+------+------+--------------+
| 2   | 72   | 8    | 3    | 70           |
+-----+------+------+------+--------------+
| 3   | 23   | 4    | 17   | 10           |
+-----+------+------+------+--------------+

Our first pass at this might be to generate the benchmark targets in
some other system, and hand-enter them into Crunch. To accomplish this,
we need to define a comparison. First, we need to define the "bases":
the cube(s) to which our comparison applies, which in our case is just
the above cube:

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {
          "name": "My benchmark",
          "bases": [{
              "dimensions": [{"variable": "88dd88"}],
              "measures": {"count": {"function": "cube_count", "args": []}}
          }]
      }


Notice, however, that we've left out the second dimension. This means
that this comparison will be available for any analysis where "88dd88"
is the row dimension. The base cube here is a sort of "supercube": a
superset of the cubes to which we might apply the comparison. We include
the measure to indicate that this comparison should apply to a
"cube\_count" (frequency count) involving variable "88dd88".

Then, we need to define target data. We are supplying these in a
hand-generated way, so our measure is simply a static column instead of
a function:

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {
          "overlay": {
              "dimensions": [{"variable": "88dd88"}],
              "measures": {
                  "count": {
                      "column": [20, 70, 10],
                      "type": {"function": "typeof", "args": [{"variable": "88dd88"}]}
                  }
              }
          }
      }


Note that our overlay has to have a dimension, too. In this case, we
simply re-use variable "88dd88" as the dimension. This ensures that our
target data is interpreted with the same category metadata as our base
analysis.

We POST the above to datasets/{id}/comparisons/ and can obtain the
overlay output at datasets/{id}/comparisons/{comparison\_id}/cube/. See
the Endpoint Reference for details.

Analyses as described above are truly multidimensional; when you add
another variable, the resulting cube obtains another dimension.
Sometimes, however, you want to compare analyses side by side, typically
looking at several (even *all*) variables against a common set of
conditioning variables. For example, you might nominate "Gender", "Age",
and "Race" as the conditioning variables and cross every other variable
with those, in order to quickly discover common correlations.

Multi-table definitions mainly provide a ``template`` member that
clients can use to construct a valid query with the variable(s) of
interest.

Crunch provides a separate catalog where you can define and manage these
common sets of variables. Like most catalogs, you can `GET
it <#multitables162>`__ to see which multitables are defined.

Template query
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A multitable is a set of queries that form groups of ‘columns’ for
different later chosen ‘row’ variables. It is defined by a **name** and
a **template**. At minimum the template must contain a ``query``
fragment: this will be later inserted after some function of a row
variable to form the `dimension <#dimensions>`__ of a result. Each
template dimension can currently only be a function of one variable.

.. language_specific::
   --HTTP
   .. code:: http

      GET datasets/{id}/multitable/3/ HTTP/1.1

      {
          "element": "shoji:entity",
          "body": {
              "name": "Geographical indicators",
              "template": [
                  {
                      "query": [
                          {
                              "variable": "../variables/de85b32/"
                          }
                      ]
                  },
                  {
                      "query": [
                          {
                              "variable": "../variables/398620f/"
                          }
                      ]
                  },
                  {
                      "query": [
                          {
                              "function": "bin",
                              "args": [
                                  {
                                      "variable": "../variables/398620f/"
                                  }
                              ]
                          }
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }
      }


Each multi-table template may be a list of variable references and other
information used to construct the dimension and transform its output.

Transforming analyses for presentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``transform`` member of an analysis specification (or multitable
definition) is a declarative definition of what the dimension should
look like after computation. The cube result dimension itself will
always be derived from the ``query`` part of the request
(``{variable: $variableId})``,
``{function: f, args: [$variableId, …]}``, &c., after which clients
should do what is necessary to arrive at the transformed result —
changing element names, orders, etc.

Structure
^^^^^^^^^

A ``transform`` can contain ``elements`` or ``categoriees``, which is an
array of target transforms for output-dimension elements. Therefore to
create a valid element/category ``transform`` it is generally necessary
to make a cube query, inspect the result dimension, and proceed from
there. For categorical and multiple response variables, elements may
also be obtained from the variable entity.

Transforms are designed for variables that are more stable than not,
with element ids that inhere in the underlying elements, such as
category or subvariable ids. Dynamic elements such as results of
``bin``\ ning a numeric variable, may not be transformed.

Transformations stored on a variable’s ``view`` are the default
transforms for that variable. They may be shorter, alternate versions of
category names, or contain insertions, described below.

Insertions
^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to transforming the categories or elements already defined
on a cube ‘dimension’, it is possible to insert headings and subtotals
to the result. These ``insertions`` are attached after an ``anchor``
element/category id.

Insertions are processed **last**, after renaming, reordering, or
sorting elements according to the elements/categories transform
specification. They are “attached” to their anchor, always following it
in the result; or, simply appended to the end of the result. If the
result is sorted by some column’s value, it may make the most sense to
choose to display insertions last, rather than inserting them into a
result table because their values will not be considered when sorting
the non-inserted elements themselves.

An insertion is defined by an anchor and a name, which will be displayed
alongside the names of categories/elements. It may also contain
``"function": "subtotal"`` and ``"args": []``, where the array of ``args`` are
the category ``id``\ s of elements to combine as “subtotals”.

Use an anchor of ``top`` to indicate an insertion before other results. Use an
anchor of ``bottom`` to indicate an insertion after other results. Any anchor
that does not match an id in the elements/categories will be included at the end
of results.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Consider the following example result dimension:

+--------------+-----------+------+
| Name         | missing   | id   |
+==============+===========+======+
| Element A    |           | 0    |
+--------------+-----------+------+
| Element B    |           | 1    |
+--------------+-----------+------+
| Element C    |           | 2    |
+--------------+-----------+------+
| Don’t know   |           | 3    |
+--------------+-----------+------+
| Not asked    | true      | 4    |
+--------------+-----------+------+

An element transform can specify a new order of output elements, new
names, and in the future, bases for hypothesis testing, result sorting,
and aggregation of results. A ``transform`` has elements that look
generally like the dimension's extent, with some optional properties:

-  **id**: (required) id of the target element/category
-  **name**: name of new target element/category
-  **sort**: ``-1`` or ``1`` indicating to sort results descending or
   ascending by this element
-  **compare**: ``neq``, ``leq``, ``geq`` indicating to test other
   rows/columns against the hypothesis that they are ≠, ≤, or ≥ to the
   present element
-  **hide**: suppress this element's row/column from displaying at all.
   Defaults to false for valid elements, true for missing, so that if an
   element is added, it will be present until a transform with
   ``hide: true`` is added to suppress it.

A ``transform`` with object members can do lots of things. Suppose we
want to put *Element C* first, hide the *Don’t know*, and more compactly
represent the result as just *C, A, B*:

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {
          "transform": {"categories": [
              {"id": 2, "name": "C"},
              {"id": 0, "name": "A"},
              {"id": 1, "name": "B"},
              {"id": 3, "hide": true}
          ]}
      }


Example transform in a saved analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a saved analysis the transforms are an array in ``display_settings``
with the same extents output dimensions (as well as, of course, the
query used to generate them). This syntax makes a univariate table of a
multiple response variable and re-orders the result.

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {
          "query": {
              "dimensions": [
                  {
                      "function": "selections",
                      "args": [{"variable": "../variables/398620f/"}]
                  },
                  {"variable": "../variables/398620f/"}
              ],
              "measures": {
                  "count": {"function": "cube_count", "args": []}
              }
          },
          "display_settings": {
              "transform": {
                  "categories": [{
                      "id": "f007",
                      "value": "My preferred first item"
                  },
                  {
                      "id": "fee7",
                      "value": "The zeroth response"
                  },
                  {
                      "id": "c001",
                      "name": "Third response"
                  }],
                  "insertions": [
                      {"anchor": "fee7", "name": "Feet", "function": "subtotal", "args": ["f00t", "fee7"]}}
                  ]
              }
          }
      }


Example transform in a multitable template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a multitable, the ``transform`` is part of each dimension definition
object in the ``template`` array.

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {
          "template": [
              {
                  "query": [
                      {"variable": "A"}
                  ],
                  "transform": [{}, {}]
              },
              {
                  "query": [
                      {
                          "function": "rollup",
                          "args": [
                              {"value": "M"},
                              {"variable": "B"}
                          ]
                      }
                  ]
              }
          ]
      }


More complex multitable templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The template may contain in addition to variable references and their
query arguments, an optional ``transform``: To obtain their multiple
output cubes, you ``GET datasets/{id}/cube?query=<q>`` where ``<q>`` is
a ZCL object in JSON format (which must then be URI encoded for
inclusion in the querystring). Use the "each" function to iterate over
the overview variables’ ``query``, producing one output cube for each
one as "variable x". For example, to cross each of the above 3 variables
against another variable "449b421":

.. language_specific::
   --JSON
   .. code:: json

      {
          "function": "each",
          "args": [
              {
                  "value": "x"
              },
              [
                  {
                      "variable": "de85b32"
                  },
                  {
                      "variable": "398620f"
                  },
                  {
                      "variable": "c116a77"
                  }
              ]
          ],
          "block": {
              "function": "cube",
              "args": [
                  [
                      {
                          "variable": "449b421"
                      },
                      {
                          "variable": "x"
                      }
                  ],
                  {
                      "map": {
                          "count": {
                              "function": "cube_count",
                              "args": []
                          }
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "value": null
                  }
              ]
          }
      }


The result will be an array of output cubes:

          "element": "shoji:view",
          "value": [
