Object Reference
================

version 0.15

The Crunch REST API takes a decidedly column-oriented approach to data.
A "column" is simply a sequence of values of the same type. A "variable"
binds a name (and other metadata) to the column, and indeed may possess
a series of columns over its lifetime as inserts and updates are made to
it. A "dataset" is a set of variables. Each variable in the dataset is
sorted the same way; the variables together form a relation. Reading the
N'th item from each variable produces a row.

Interaction with the Crunch REST API is by variables and columns. When
you add data to Crunch, you send a set of columns. When you fetch data
from Crunch, you send a set of variable expressions and receive a set of
columns. When you update data in Crunch, you send a set of expressions
which tells Crunch how to update variables with new column data.

The Crunch API consists of just a few primitive objects, arranged
differently for each request and response. Learning the basic components
will help you create the most complicated queries.

Response types
--------------

Shoji entity
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Shoji entity is identified by the ``element`` key having value
``shoji:entity``. Its principal attribute is the ``body`` key, which is
an object containing the attributes that describe the entity.

Shoji catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A catalog is identified by its ``element`` key having value
``shoji:catalog`` with its principal attribute being ``index`` that
contains an object keyed by the URLs of the entities it contains and for
each key an object (tuple) with attributes from the referenced entity.

Shoji catalogs are **not** ordered. For its ordered representations they
may provide an ``orders`` set of Shoji order resources.

Shoji view
~~~~~~~~~~

A Shoji view is identified by its ``element`` key having value
``shoji:view`` with its principal attribute being ``value``. This can
contain any arbitrary JSON object.

Shoji order
~~~~~~~~~~~

Shoji orders are identified by the ``element`` key having a value
``shoji:order``. Their principal attribute is the ``graph`` key which is
an array containing the order of present resources.

A shoji order may be associated with a catalog. In such case it will
contain a subset or totality of the entities present in the catalog. The
catalog remains as the authoritative source of available entities.

Any entity not present on the order but present in the catalog may be
considered to belong at the bottom of the root of the graph in an
arbitrary order, or may be excluded from view.

Statistical data
----------------

Identifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~

Datasets, variables, and other resources are always identified by
strings. All identifiers are case-sensitive, and may contain any unicode
character, including spaces. Examples:

-  "q1"
-  "My really useful dataset"
-  "变量"

Data Values
~~~~~~~~~~~

Individual data values follow the JSON representations where possible.
JSON exposes the following types: number, string, array, object, true,
false, null. Crunch adds additional types with special syntax (see
Types, below). Examples:

-  13
-  45.330495
-  "foo"
-  [3, 4, 5]
-  {"bar": {"a": [12.4, 89.2, 0]}}
-  true
-  null
-  "2014-03-02T14:29:59Z"

Because a single JSON type may be used to represent multiple Crunch
types, you should never rely on the JSON type to interpret the class of
a datum. Instead, inspect the type object (see below) to interpret the
data.

Missing values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Crunch provides a robust "missing entries" system. Anywhere a (valid)
data value can appear, a missing value may also appear. Missing values
are represented by an object with a single "?" key. The value is a
missing integer code (see Missing reasons, below); negative integers are
reserved for system-generated reasons, user-defined reasons are
automatically assigned positive integers. Examples:

-  {"?": -1}
-  {"?": 24}

Arrays
^^^^^^

A set of data values (and/or missing values) which are of the same type
can be ordered in an array. All entries in an array are of the same
Crunch type.

Examples:

-  [13, 4, 5, {"?": -2}, 7, 2]
-  ["foo", "bar"]

Enumerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some arrays, rather than repeating a small set of large values, benefit
from storing a small integer code instead, moving the larger values they
represent into the metadata, and doing lookups when needed to
encode/decode. The "categorical" type is the most common example of
this: rather than store an array of large string names like ["Internet
Explorer", "Internet Explorer", "Firefox", ...] it instead stores
integer codes like: [1, 1, 2], placing the longer strings in the
metadata as type.categories = [{"id": 1, "name": "Internet Explorer",
...}, ...]. We call this encoding process enumeration, and its opposite,
where the coded are re-expanded into their original values, elaboration.

Enumeration also provides the opportunity to order the possible values,
as well as include potential values which do not yet exist in the data
array itself.

Enumeration typically causes the volume of data to shrink dramatically,
and can speed up very common operations like filtering, grouping, and
almost any data transfer. Because of this, it is common to:

-  Enumerate a data array as early as possible. Indeed, when a variable
   can be enumerated, the fastest way to insert new data is to send the
   new values as the integer codes.
-  Elaborate a data array as late as possible. As long as the metadata
   is shipped along with the enumerated data, the transfer size and
   therefore time is much smaller. Many cases do not even call for a
   complete elaboration of the entire column.

Variable Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Crunch employs a structural type system rather than a nominative one.
The variable definition includes more knowledge than just the type name
(numeric, text, categorical, etc); we also learn details about range,
precision, missing values and reasons, order, etc. For example:

.. language_specific::
   --Json
   .. code:: json

      {
          "type": "categorical",
          "name": "Party ID",
          "description": "Do you consider yourself generally a Democrat, a Republican, or an Independent?",
          "categories": [
              {
                  "name": "Republican",
                  "numeric_value": 1,
                  "id": 1,
                  "missing": false
              },
              {
                  "name": "Democrat",
                  "numeric_value": -1,
                  "id": 2,
                  "missing": false
              },
              {
                  "name": "Independent",
                  "numeric_value": 0,
                  "id": 3,
                  "missing": false
              }
          ]
      }


This section describes the metadata of a variable as exposed across
HTTP, both expected response values and valid input values.

Variable types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "type" of a Variable is a string which defines the superset of
values from which the variable may draw. The type governs not only the
set of values but also their syntax. (See below.)

The following types are defined for public use:

-  text
-  numeric
-  categorical
-  datetime
-  multiple\_response
-  categorical\_array

Variable names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Variables in Crunch have multiple attributes that provide identifying
information: "name", "alias", and "description".

name
''''

Crunch takes a principled stand that variable "names" should be for
people, not for computers.

You may be used to domains that have variable "name", "label", and
"description". Name is some short, unique, machine-friendlier ID like
"Q2"; label is short and human-friendly, something like "Brand
awareness", and description is where you might put question wording if
you have survey data. Crunch has "alias", "name", and "description".
What you may be used to thinking of as a variable name, we consider as
an alias: something for more internal use, not something appropriate for
a polished dataset ready to share with people who didn't create the
dataset (See more in the "Alias" section below). In Crunch, the
variable's "name" is what you may be used to thinking of as a label.

All variables must have a name, and these names must be unique across
all variables, including "hidden" variables (see below) but excluding
subvariables (see "Subvariables" below). Within an array variable,
subvariable names must be unique. (You can think of subvariable names
within an array as being variable\_name.subvariable\_name, and with that
approach, all "variable names" must be unique.)

Names must be a string of length greater than zero, and any valid
unicode string is allowed. See "Identifiers" above.

alias
'''''

Alias is a string identifier for variables. It must be unique across all
variables, including subvariables, such that it can be used as an
identifier. This is what legacy statistical software typically calls a
variable name.

Aliases have several uses. Client applications, such as those exposing a
scripting interface, may want to use aliases as a more machine-friendly,
yet still human-readable, way of referencing variables. Aliases may also
be used to help line up variables across different import batches.

When creating variables via the API, alias is not a required field; if
omitted, an alias will be generated. If an alias is supplied, it must be
unique across all variables, including subvariables, and the new
variable request will be rejected if the alias is not unique. When data
are imported from file formats that have unique variable names, those
names will in many cases be used as the alias in Crunch.

description
'''''''''''

Description is an optional string that provides more information about
the variable. It is displayed in the web application on variable summary
cards and with analyses.

Type-specific attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These attributes must be present for the specified variable types when
creating a variable, but they are not defined for other types.

categories
''''''''''

Categorical variables must contain an array of Category objects, each of
which includes:

-  **id**: a read-only integer identifier for the category. These
   correspond to the data values.
-  **name**: the string name which applications should use to identify
   the category.
-  **numeric\_value**: the numeric value bound to each name. If no
   numeric value should be bound, this should be null. numeric\_values
   need not be unique, and they may be ``null``.
-  **missing**: (optional) boolean indicating whether the data
   corresponding to this category should be interpreted as missing.
-  **selected**: (optional) boolean indicating whether this category
   should be treated as a "true" value for logical operations. Defaults
   to ``false`` if omitted. Multiple response variables are essentially
   logical categorical arrays, and therefore must have at least one
   "selected" category. More than one Category may be marked "selected".


Categories are valid if:

-  Category names are unique within the set
-  Category ids are unique within the set
-  Category ids for user-defined categories are positive integers no
   greater than 32767. Negative ids are reserved for system missing
   reasons. See "missing\_reasons" below.

The order of the array defines the order of the categories, and thus the
order in which aggregate data will be presented. This order can be
changed by saving a reordered set of Categories.

subvariables
''''''''''''

Multiple Response and Categorical Array variables contain an array of
subvariable references. In the HTTP API, these are presented as URLs. To
create a variable of type "multiple\_response" or "categorical\_array",
you must include a "subvariables" member with an array of subvariable
references. These variables will become the subvariables in the new
array variable.

Like Categories, the array of subvariables within an array variable
indicate the order in which they are presented; to reorder them, save a
modified array of subvariable ids/urls.

subreferences
'''''''''''''

Multiple Response and Categorical Array variables contain an object of
subvariable "references": names, alias, description, etc. To create a
variable of type "multiple\_response" or "categorical\_array" directly,
you must include a "subreferences" member with an object of objects.
These label the subvariables in the new array variable.

The shape of each subreferences member must contain a name and
optionally an alias. Note that the subreferences is an unordered object.
The order of the subvariables is read from the "subvariables" attribute.

.. language_specific::
   --Json
   .. code:: json

      {
          "type": "categorical_array",
          "name": "Example array",
          "categories": [
              {
                  "name": "Category 1",
                  "numeric_value": 1,
                  "id": 1,
                  "missing": false
              },
              {
                  "name": "Category 2",
                  "numeric_value": 0,
                  "id": 2,
                  "missing": false
              }
          ],
          "subvariables": [
            "/api/datasets/abcdef/variables/abc/subvariables/1/",
            "/api/datasets/abcdef/variables/abc/subvariables/2/",
            "/api/datasets/abcdef/variables/abc/subvariables/3/"
          ],
          "subreferences": {
              "/api/datasets/abcdef/variables/abc/subvariables/2/": {"name": "subvariable 2", "alias": "subvar2_alias"},
              "/api/datasets/abcdef/variables/abc/subvariables/1/": {"name": "subvariable 1"},
              "/api/datasets/abcdef/variables/abc/subvariables/3/": {"name": "subvariable 3"}
          }
      }


resolution
''''''''''

Datetime variables must have a resolution string that indicates the unit
size of the datetime data. Valid values include "Y", "M", "D", "h", "m",
"s", and "ms". Every datetime variable must have a resolution.

Other definition attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These attributes may be supplied on variable creation, and they are
included in API responses unless otherwise noted.

format
''''''

An object with various members to control the display of Variable data:

-  data: An object with a "digits" member, stating how many digits to
   display after the decimal point.
-  summary: An object with a "digits" member, stating how many digits to
   display after the decimal point.

view
''''

An object with various members to control the display of Variable data:

-  show\_codes: For categorical types only. If true, numeric values are
   shown.
-  show\_counts: If true, show counts; if false, show percents.
-  include\_missing: For categorical types only. If true, include
   missing categories.
-  include\_noneoftheabove: For multiple-response types only. If true,
   display a "none of the above" category in the requested summary or
   analysis.
-  geodata: A list of associations of a variable to Crunch geodatm
   entities. PATCH a variable entity amending the ``view.geodata`` in
   order to create, modify, or remove an association. An association is
   an object with required keys ``geodatum``, ``feature_key``, and
   optional ``match_field``. The geodatum must exist; ``feature_key`` is
   the name of the property of each ‘feature’ in the geojson/topojson
   that corresponds to the ``match_field`` of the variable (perhaps a
   dotted string for nested properties; e.g. ”properties.postal-code”).
   By default, ``match_field`` is “name”: a categorical variable will
   match category names to the ``feature_key`` present in the given
   geodatum.

discarded
'''''''''

Discarded is a boolean value indicating whether the variable should be
viewed as part of the dataset. Hiding variables by setting discarded to
True is like a soft, restorable delete method.

Default is ``false``.

private
'''''''

If ``true``, the variable will not show in the common variable catalog;
instead, it will be included in the personal variables catalog.

missing\_reasons
''''''''''''''''

An object whose keys are reason strings and whose values are the codes
used for missing entries.

Crunch allows any entry in a column to be either a valid value or a
missing code. Regardless of the class, missing codes are represented in
the interface as an object with a single "?" key mapped to a single
missing integer code. For example, a segment of [4.56, 9.23, {"?": -1}]
includes 2 valid values and 1 missing value.

The missing codes map to a reason phrase via this "missing reasons" type
member. Entries which are missing for reasons determined by the system
are negative integers. Users may define their own missing reasons, which
receive positive integer codes. Zero is a reserved value.

In the above example, the code of -1 would be looked up in a missing
reasons map such as:

.. language_specific::
   --Json
   .. code:: json

      {
          "missing reasons": {
              "no data": -1,
              "type mismatch": -2,
              "my backup was corrupted": 1
          }
      }


See the Endpoint Reference for user-defined missing reasons.

Categorical variables do not require a missing\_reasons object because
the categories array contains the information about missingness.

Values
^^^^^^

When creating a new variable, one can also include a "values" member
that contains the data column corresponding to the variable metadata.
See Importing Data: Column-by-column. This subsection outlines how the
various variable types have their values formatted both when one
supplies values to add to the dataset and when one requests values from
a dataset.

Text
''''

Text values are an array of quoted strings. Missing values are indicated
as ``{"?": <integer>}``, as discussed above, and all integer missing
value codes must be defined in the "missing\_reasons" object of the
variable's metadata.

Numeric
'''''''

A "numeric" value will always be e.g. 500 (a number, without quotes) in
the JSON request and response messages, not "500" (a string, with
quotes). Missing values are handled as with text variables.

Categorical
'''''''''''

Insert an array of integers that correspond to the ids of the variable's
categories. Only integers found in the category ids are allowed. That
is, you cannot insert values for which there is no category metadata. It
is, however, permitted to have categories defined for which there are no
values.

Datetime
''''''''

Datetime input and output are in ISO-8601 formatted strings.

Arrays
''''''

Crunch supports array type variables, which contain an array of
subvariables. "Multiple response" and "Categorical array" are both
arrays of categorical subvariables. Subvariables do not exist as
independent variables; they are exposed as "virtual" variables in some
places, and can be analyzed independently, but they do not have their
own type or categories.

Arrays are currently always categorical, so they send and receive data
in the same format: category ids. The only difference is that regular
categorical variables send and receive one id per row, where arrays send
and receive a list of ids (of equal length to the number of subvariables
in the array).

Variables
~~~~~~~~~

A complete Variable, then, is simply a Definition combined with its data
array.

Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Crunch expressions are used to compute on a dataset, to do nuanced
selects, updates, and deletes, and to accomplish many other routine
operations. Expressions are JSON objects in which each term is wrapped
in an object which declares whether the term is a variable, a value, or
a function, etc. While verbose, doing so allows us to be more explicit
about the operations we wish to do.

Expressions generally contain references to **variables**, **values**,
or **columns** of values, often composed in **functions**. The output of
expressions can be other variables, values, or cube
aggregations, depending on the context and expression content. Some
endpoints have special semantics, but the general structure of the
expressions follows the model described below.

Variable terms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Terms refer to variables when they include a "variable" member. The
value is the URL for the desired variable. For example:

-  ``{"variable": "../variables/X/"}``
-  ``{"variable": "https://app.crunch.io/api/datasets/48ffc3/joins/abcd/variables/Y/"}``

URLs must either be absolute or relative to the URL of the current
request. For example, to refer to a variable in a query at
``https://app.crunch.io/api/datasets/48ffc3/cube/``, a variable at
``https://app.crunch.io/api/datasets/48ffc3/variables/9410fc/`` may be
referenced by its full URL or by "../variables/9410fc/".

Value terms
^^^^^^^^^^^

Terms refer to data values when they include a "value" member. Its value
is any individual data value; that is, a value that is addressable by a
column and row in the dataset. For example:

-  ``{"value": 13}``
-  ``{"value": [3, 4, 5]}``

Note that individual values may themselves be complex arrays or objects,
depending on their type. You may explicitly include a "type" member in
the object, or let Crunch infer the type. One way to do this is to use
the "typeof" function to indicate that the value you're specifying
corresponds to the exact type of an existing variable. See "functions"
below for more details.

Column terms
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Terms refer to columns (construct them, actually) when they include a
"column" member. The value is an array of data values. You may include
"type" and/or "references" members as well.

-  ``{"column": [1, 2, 3, 17]}``
-  ``{"column": [{"?": -2}, 1, 4, 1], "type": {"class": "categorical", "categories": [...], ...}}``

Function terms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Terms refer to functions (and operators) when they include a "function"
member. The value is the identifier for the desired function. They
parameterize the function with an "args" member, whose value is an array
of terms, one for each argument. Examples:

-  ``{"function": "==", "args": [{"variable": "../variables/X/"}, {"value": 13}]}``
-  ``{"function": "contains", "args": [{"variable": "../joins/abcd/variables/Y/"}, {"value": "foo"}]}``

You may include a "references" member to provide a name, alias,
description, etc to the output of the function.

Supported functions
'''''''''''''''''''

Here is a list of all functions available for crunch expressions. Note
that these functions can be used in conjuction to compose an expression.

Array functions
'''''''''''''''

- ``array`` Return the given Frame as an array. The type of each variable in the Frame must be close enough to form a supertype for the array.
- ``get`` Return a subvariable from the given column.
- ``subvariables`` Return a Frame containing subvariables of the given array.
- ``tiered`` Return a variable formed by collapsing the given array's subvariables in the given category tiers.
 

Binary functions
''''''''''''''''

In general, these operate only on "numeric" types.

-  ``+`` add
-  ``-`` subtract
-  ``*`` multiply
-  ``/`` div divide
-  ``//`` floor division
-  ``^`` power
-  ``%`` modulus
-  ``&`` bitwise and
-  ``|`` bitwise or
-  ``~`` invert

Logic functions
'''''''''''''''

These all return a "logical" categorical column with just three categories: one is marked "selected", one is marked "missing", and the other is neither.

User interfaces may use the presence of a "selected" category to decide to reduce analyses to only show the "selected" category.
 
Any "logical" column can be used as a filter expression; rows which result in a "selected" value will match the filter, and those which are "missing" or "other" will not.

-  ``==`` equals. Exact matches will return "selected". For non-matching values, if either input term is missing, the result is missing. Otherwise, the result is "other".
-  ``!=`` not equals. Exact matches will return "other". For non-matching values, if either input term is missing, the result is missing. Otherwise, the result is "selected". This is the same result as ``not(==)``.
-  ``=><=`` between
-  ``between`` between
-  ``<`` less than
-  ``>`` greater than
-  ``<=`` less than or equal
-  ``>=`` greater than or equal
-  ``in`` "selected" for each row where A is an element of array B, or a key of object B.
-  ``all`` "selected" for each row where all subvariables in a
   multiple\_response array are selected
-  ``any`` "selected" for each row where any subvariable in a
   multiple\_response array is selected
-  ``is_none_of_the_above`` "selected" for each row where no subvariables in a
   multiple\_response array are selected, unless all subvariables have
   missing values
-  ``contains`` "selected" for each row where text value A is a substring of text value B.
-  ``icontains`` Case-insensitive version of 'contains'
-  ``~=`` compare against regular expression (regex)
-  ``and`` logical and. A "selected" value ``and`` "selected" results in "selected".
   If either input term is missing, the result is missing. Otherwise, the result is "other".
-  ``or`` logical or. If either input term is "selected", the result is "selected".
   A "missing" value ``or`` "missing" results in "missing". Otherwise, the result is "other".
-  ``not`` logical not; this is the "relative complement"--any missing values will remain missing.
-  ``not_selected`` logical not; this is the "absolute complement"--any missing values will become "selected".
-  ``selected`` returns "selected" only for "selected" categories; "other" and "missing" values will become "other".
-  ``is_valid`` Logical array of rows which are valid for the given column
-  ``is_missing`` Logical array of rows which are missing for the given column
-  ``any_missing`` Logical array of rows where any of the subvariables are missing
-  ``all_valid`` Logical array of rows where all of the subvariables are valid
-  ``all_missing`` Logical array of rows where all of the subvariables are missing

Selection functions
'''''''''''''''''''

-  ``as_selected`` Return the given variable reduced to the [1, 0, -1]
   "logical" categories.
-  ``selected_array`` Return a bool Array from the given categorical,
   plus None/``__none__``/``__any__`` .
-  ``selected_depth`` Return a numeric column containing the number of
   selected categories in each row of the given array.
-  ``selections`` Return the given array, reduced to the [1, 0, -1]
   "logical" categories, plus an ``__any__`` magic subvariable.

Miscellaneous functions
'''''''''''''''''''''''

-  ``bin`` Return column's values broken into equidistant bins.
-  ``case`` Evaluate the given conditions in order, selecting the
   corresponding choice.
-  ``cast`` Return a Column of column's values cast to the given type.
-  ``char_length`` Return the length of each string (or missing reason)
   in the given column.
-  ``copy_variable`` Returns a copy of the column with a copy of its
   metadata.
-  ``combine_categories`` Return a column of categories combined
   according to the category\_info.
-  ``combine_responses`` Combine the given categorical variables into a
   new one.
-  ``current_batch`` Return the batch\_id of the current frame.
-  ``lookup`` Map each row of source through its keys index to a
   corresponding value.
-  ``missing`` Return the given column as missing for the given reason.
-  ``normalize`` Return a Column with the given values normalized so
   sum(c) == len(c).
-  ``row`` Return a Numeric column with row indices.
-  ``typeof`` Return (a copy of) the Type of the given column.
-  ``unmissing`` Return the given column with user missing replaced by
   valid values.

-  ``format_datetime`` Convert datetime values to strings using the fmt
   as strftime mask.
-  ``numeric_to_datetime`` Convert the given numeric column to datetime
   with the given resolution.

Frame Functions
'''''''''''''''

-  ``page`` Return the given frame, limited/offset by the given values.
-  ``select`` Return a Frame of results from the given map of variables.
-  ``sheet`` Return the given frame, limited/offset in the number of
   variables.
-  ``dependents`` Return the given frame with only dependents of the
   given variable.
-  ``deselect`` Return a frame NOT including the indicated variables.
-  ``adapt`` Return the given frame adapted to the given to\_key.
-  ``join`` Return a JoinedFrame from the given list of subframes.
-  ``find`` Return a Frame with those variables which match the given
   criteria.
-  ``flatten`` Return a frame including all variables, plus all
   subvariables at dotted ids.

.. language_specific::
   --Json
   .. code:: json

      {
        "function": "select",
        "args": [{
          "map": {
            <destination id>: {variable: <source frame id>},
            <destination id>: {variable: <source frame id>},
            ...
          }
        }]

      }


-  **select**: Receives an argument which is a map expression in the
   following shape:

Where ``destination id`` is the ID that the mapped variable will have on
the resulting frame by selecting only the ``source frame id`` variables
from the frame where this function is applied on.

.. language_specific::
   --Json
   .. code:: json

      {
        "function": "deselect",
        "args": [{
          "map": {
            <destination id>: {variable: <source frame id>},
            <destination id>: {variable: <source frame id>},
            ...
          }
        }]

      }


-  **deselect**: Same as ``select`` but will exclude the variable ids
   mentioned from the source frame. On this usage the ``destination id``
   part of the ``map`` argument are disregarded.

-  ``stack`` Return a cube of 1 more dimension formed by stacking the
   given array.

Filter terms
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Terms that refer to filters entities by URL are shorthand for the
logical expression stored in the entity. So,
``{"filter": "../filters/59fc4d/"}`` yields the Crunch expression
contained in the Filter entity's "expression" attribute. Filter terms
can be combined together with other expressions as well. For example,
``{"function": "and", "args": [{"filter": "../filters/59fc4d/"}, {"function": "==", "args": [{"variable": "../variables/X/"}, {"value": 13}]}]}``
would "and" together the logical expression in filter 59fc4d with the
``X == 13`` expression.

Documents
---------

Shoji
~~~~~

Most representations returned from the API are Shoji Documents. Shoji is
a media type designed to foster scalable API's. Shoji is built with
JSON, so any JSON parser should be able to at least deserialize Shoji
documents. Shoji adds four document types: Entity, Catalog, View, and
Order.

Entity
^^^^^^

Anything that can be thought of as "a thing by itself" will probably be
represented by a Shoji Entity Document. Entities possess a "body"
member: a JSON object where each key/value pair is an attribute name and
value. For example:

.. language_specific::
   --Json
   .. code:: json

      {
          "element": "shoji:entity",
          "self": "https://.../api/users/1/",
          "description": "Details for a User.",
          "specification": "https://.../api/specifications/users/",
          "fragments": {
              "address": "address/"
          },
          "body": {
              "first_name": "Genghis",
              "last_name": "Khan"
          }
      }


In general, an HTTP GET to the "self" URL will return the document, and
a PUT of the same will update it. PUT should not be used for partial
updates–use PATCH for that instead. In general, each member included in
the "body" of a PATCH message will replace the current representation;
attributes not included will not be altered. There is no facility to
remove an attribute from an Entity.body via PATCH. In some cases,
however, even finer-grained control is possible via PATCH; see the
Endpoint Reference for details.

Catalog
^^^^^^^

Catalogs collect or contain entities. They act as an index to a
collection, and indeed possess an "index" member for this:

.. language_specific::
   --Json
   .. code:: json

      {
          "element": "shoji:catalog",
          "self": "https://.../api/users/",
          "description": "A list of all the users.",
          "specification": "https://.../api/specifications/users/",
          "orders": {
              "default": "default_order/"
          },
          "index": {
              "2/": {"active": true},
              "1/": {"active": false},
              "4/": {"active": true},
              "3/": {"active": true}
          }
      }


Each key in the index is a URL (possibly relative to "self") which
refers to a different resource. Often, these are Shoji Entity documents,
but not always. The index also allows some attributes to be published as
a set, rather than in each individual Entity. This allows clients to act
on the collection as a whole, such as when rendering a list of
references from which the user might select one entity.

In general, an HTTP GET to the "self" URL will return the document, and
a PUT of the same will update it. Many catalogs allow POST to add a new
entity to the collection. PUT should not be used for partial
updates--use PATCH for that instead. In general, each member included in
the "index" of a PATCH message will replace the current representation;
tuples not included will not be altered. Tuples included in a PATCH
which are not present in the server's current representation of the
index may be added; it is up to each resource whether to support (and
document!) this approach or prefer POST to add entities to the
collection. In general, catalogs that *contain* entities get new
entities created by POST, while catalogs that *collect* entities that
are contained by other catalogs (e.g. a catalog of users who have
permissions on a dataset) will have entities added by PATCH.

Similarly, removing entities from catalogs is supported in one of two
ways, typically varying by catalog type. For catalogs that contain
entities, entities are removed only by DELETE on the entity's URL (its
key in the Catalog.index). In contrast, for catalogs that collect
entities, entities are removed by PATCHing the catalog with a ``null``
tuple. This removes the entity from the catalog but does not delete the
entity (which is contained by a different catalog). T

View
^^^^

Views cut across entities. They can publish nearly any arrangement of
data, and are especially good for exposing arrays of arrays and the
like. In general, a Shoji View is read-only, and only a GET will be
successful.

Order
^^^^^

Orders can arrange any set of strings into an arbitrarily-nested tree;
most often, they are used to provide one or more orderings of a
Catalog's index. For example, each user may have their own ordering for
an index of variables; the same URL's from the index keys are arranged
in the Order. Given the Catalog above, for example, we might produce an
Order like:

.. language_specific::
   --Json
   .. code:: json

      {
          "element": "shoji:order",
          "self": "https://.../api/users/order/",
          "graph": [
              "2/",
              {"group A": ["1/", "3/", "2/"]},
              {"group B": ["4/"]}
          ]
      }


This represents the tree:

::

          /  |  \
         2  {A} {B}
           / | \  \
          1  3  2  4

The Order object itself allows lots of flexibility. Each of the
following decisions are up to the API endpoint to constrain or not as it
sees fit (see the Endpoint Reference for these details):

-  Not every string in the original set has to be present, allowing
   partial orders.
-  Strings from the original set which are not mentioned may be ignored,
   or default to an "ungrouped" group, or other behaviors as each
   application sees fit.
-  Groups may contain member strings and other groups interleaved (but
   still ordered).
-  Groups may exist without any members.
-  Members may appear in more than one group.
-  Group names may be repeated at different points within the tree.
-  Group member arrays, although represented in a JSON array, may be
   declared to be non-strict in their order (that is, the array should
   be treated more like an unordered set).

Crunch Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the other representations returned from the API are Crunch
Objects. They are built with JSON, so any JSON parser should be able to
at least deserialize Crunch documents. Crunch adds two document types:
Table and Cube.

Table
^^^^^

Tables collect columns of data and (optionally) their metadata into
two-dimensional relations.

.. language_specific::
   --Json
   .. code:: json

      {
          "element": "crunch:table",
          "self": "https://.../api/datasets/.../table/?limit=7",
          "description": "The data belonging to this Dataset.",
          "metadata": {
              "1ef0455": {"name": "Education", "type": "categorical", "categories": [...], ...},
              "588392a": {"name": "Favorite color", "type": "text", ...}
          },
          "data": {
              "1ef0455": [6, 4, 7, 7, 3, 2, 1],
              "588392a": ["green", "red", "blue", "Red", "RED", "pink", " red"]
          }
      }


Each key in the "data" member is a variable identifier, and its
corresponding value is a column of Crunch data values. The data values
in a given column are homogeneous, but across columns they are
heterogeneous. The lengths of all columns MUST be the same. The
"metadata" member is optional; if given, it MUST contain matching keys
that correspond to variable definitions.

Like any JSON object, the "data" and "metadata" objects are explicitly
unordered. When supplying a crunch:table, such as when POST'ing to
datasets/ to create a new dataset, you must supply an Order if you want
an explicit variable order.

Cube
^^^^

Cubes have both input and output formats. The "crunch:cube" element is
used for the output only.

Cube input
''''''''''

The input format may vary slightly according to the API endpoint (since
some parameters may be inherent in the particular resource), but
involves the same basic ingredients.

Example:

.. language_specific::
   --Json
   .. code:: json

      {
          "dimensions": [
              {"variable": "datasets/ab8832/variables/3ffd45/"},
              {"function": "+", "args": [{"variable": "datasets/ab8832/variables/2098f1/"}, {"value": 5}]}
          ],
          "measures": {
              "count": {"function": "cube_count", "args": []}
          }
      }


dimensions
          

An array of input expressions. Each expression contributes one dimension
to the output cube. The only exception is when a dimension results in a
boolean (true/false) column, in which case the data are filtered by it
as a mask instead of adding a dimension to the output.

When a dimension is added, the resulting axis consists of distinct
values rather than all values. Variables which are already "categorical"
or "enumerated" will simply use their "categories" or "elements" as the
extent. Other variables form their extents from their distinct values.

measures
        

A set of cube functions to populate each cell of the cube. You can
request multiple functions over the same dimensions (such as
“cube\_mean” and “cube\_stddev”) or more commonly just one (like
“cube\_count”). Each member MUST be a ZZ9 cube function designed for the
purpose. See ZZ9 User Guide:Cube Functions for a list of such functions
and their arguments.

filters
       

An array containing references to filters that need to be applied to the
dataset before starting the cube calculations. It can be an empty array
or null, in which case no filtering will be applied.

weight
      

A reference to a variable to be used as the weight on all cube
operations.

Cube output
'''''''''''

Cubes collect columns of measure data in an arbitrary number of
dimensions. Multiple measures in the same cube share dimensions,
effectively overlaying each other. For example, a cube might contain a
"count" measure and a "mean" measure with the same shape:

.. language_specific::
   --Json
   .. code:: json

      {
          "element": "crunch:cube",
          "n": 210,
          "missing": 12,
          "dimensions": [
              {"references": {"name": "A", ...}, "type": {"class": "categorical", "categories": [{"id": 1, ...}, {"id": 2, ...}, {"id": 3, ...}]}},
              {"references": {"name": "B", ...}, "type": {"class": "categorical", "categories": [{"id": 11, ...}, {"id": 12, ...}]}}
          ],
          "measures": {
              "count": {
                  "metadata": {"references": {}, "type": {"class": "numeric", "integer": true, ...}},
                  "data": [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60],
                  "n_missing": 12
              },
              "mean": {
                  "metadata": {"references": {}, "type": {"class": "numeric", ...}},
                  "data": [3.5, 17.8, 9.9, 7.32, 0, 23.4],
                  "n_missing": 12
              }
          },
          "margins": {
              "data": [210],
              "0": {"data": [30, 70, 110]},
              "1": {"data": [90, 120]}
          }
      }


dimensions
          

The "dimensions" member is the most straightforward: an array of
variable Definition objects. Each one defines an axis of the cube's
output. This may be different from the input dimensions' definitions.
For example, when counting numeric variables, the input dimension might
be an expression involving the bin builtin function. Even though the
input variable is of type "numeric", the output dimension would be of
type "enum" .

n
 

The number of rows considered for all measures.

measures
        

The "measures" member includes one object for each measure. The
"metadata" member of each tells you the name, type and other definitions
of the measure. The "data" member of each is a flattened array of values
for that measure; the dimensions stride into that array in order, with
the last dimension varying the fastest. In the example above, the first
dimension ("A") has 3 categories, while "B" has 2; therefore, the "flat"
array [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60] for the "count" measure is interpreted as
the "unflattened" array [[10, 20], [30, 40], [50, 60]]. Graphically:

+-------+--------+--------+
|       | B:11   | B:12   |
+=======+========+========+
| A:1   | 10     | 20     |
+-------+--------+--------+
| A:2   | 30     | 40     |
+-------+--------+--------+
| A:3   | 50     | 60     |
+-------+--------+--------+

This is known in NumPy and other domains as "C order" (versus "Fortran
order" which would be interpreted as [[10, 30, 50], [20, 40, 60]]
instead).

n\_missing
          

The number of rows that are missing for this measure. Because different
measures may have different inputs (the column to take the mean of, for
example, or weighted versus unweighted), this number may vary from one
measure to another even though the total "n" is the same for all.

margins
       

The "margins" member is optional. When present, it is a tree of nested
margins with one level of depth for each dimension. At the top, we
always include the "grand total" for all dimensions. Then, we include a
branch for each axis we "unroll". So, for example, for a 3-dimensional
cube of X, Y, and Z, the margins member might contain:

.. language_specific::
   --Json
   .. code:: json

      {
      "margins": {
          "data": [4526],
          "0": {
              "data": [1755, 2771],
              "1": {"data": [
                  [601, 370, 322, 269, 147, 46],
                  [332, 215, 596, 523, 437, 668]
              ]},
              "2": {"data": [[1198, 557], [1493, 1278]]}
          },
          "1": {
              "data": [933, 585, 918, 792, 584, 714],
              "0": {"data": [
                  [601, 370, 322, 269, 147, 46],
                  [332, 215, 596, 523, 437, 668]
              ]},
              "2": {"data": [
                  [825, 108], [560, 25], [325, 593],
                  [417, 375], [191, 393], [373, 341]
              ]}
          },
          "2": {
              "data": [2691, 1835],
              "0": {"data": [[1198, 557], [1493, 1278]]},
              "1": {"data": [
                  [825, 108], [560, 25], [325, 593],
                  [417, 375], [191, 393], [373, 341]
              ]}
          }
      }


Again, each branch in the tree is an axis we "unroll" from the grand
total. So margins[0][2] contains the margin where X (axis 0) and Z (axis
2) are unrolled, and only Y (axis 1) is still "rolled up".
