      <description>Crunch is seeking talented, motivated, and versatile software developers to help build our next-generation dataset-management platform, all the way from physical bits to complete analyses and visualizations. You would work with the rest of our team to design and implement novel features that deliver real value and change our clients’ workflows for the better. We’re looking for people who like to write beautiful, interactive, scalable software that just happens to run in a web browser.</description>

      <description>Crunch is seeking talented, motivated front-end engineers to build our interactive data applications. You would work with the rest of our team to help build a product that is changing the way our clients do their work. Both technical and aesthetic details matter greatly to you. (You like to use both arrow functions and en-dashes appropriately.) You want to surround yourself with talented peers who share your dedication. In short, you write solid, thoroughly tested, and readable code.</description>
