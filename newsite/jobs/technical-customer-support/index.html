<li>Detail oriented.  Attention to detail is your trademark with a strong desire to find solutions for problems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remote working</strong></p>
<p>We are a remote company, with all employees working remotely. We believe in hiring the best people, not restricted by geography. For this role, we need flexibility in time zone coverage (eg: may encompass coverage of US &amp; European time zones for support). Working remotely requires high motivation and the ability to report back on productivity.  We also believe that it fosters an excellent work/life balance for our employees.</p>
<p><strong>Employee benefits</strong></p>
<p>We are a startup, with a fast paced startup culture. We are funded by and operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of a public company, so our employees benefit from the excellent benefits and opportunities provided by a large company.</p>
