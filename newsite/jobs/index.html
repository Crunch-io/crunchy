<li>Provide consistent, high-quality feedback and recommendations to our product managers and development teams regarding product defects or recurring performance issues.</li>

<p>We are hiring a Python Developer to help develop our platform. We are inviting you to join our small, fully remote team of developers and operators helping make our platform faster, more secure, and more reliable.

<p>We are looking for someone who is a quick study, who is eager to learn and grow with us, and who has experience in Agile cultures.

Some of the ways that we accomplish that include paired programming to tackle a hard problem, transparent code reviews, and discussions about design and architecture. Since Crunch’s employees are completely distributed, it’s crucial that you can work well independently, and keep yourself motivated and focused.

<li>Develop performance enhancements and new features in Crunch&rsquo;s proprietary Python in-memory database.</li>
<li>Work closely with product managers, sales, and customer success team to understand the system’s functional and non-functional requirements.</li>
<li>Establish realistic estimates for timelines and ensure that project remains on target to meet deadlines.</li>
<li>Contribute to code quality through unit testing, integration testing, code review, and system design using Python.</li>
<li>Assist in diagnosing and fixing system failures quickly when they occur in your area of expertise. This is limited to when the on-call rotation needs a subject matter expert to help troubleshoot an issue.</li>
<li>Design and implement RESTful API endpoints using the Python programming language.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basic qualifications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strong understanding of the software development lifecycle.</li>
