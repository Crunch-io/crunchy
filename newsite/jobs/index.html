                                    <p><strong>Reports to</strong>: Manager of Customer Service</p>
<p><strong>Work location</strong>: Remote</p>
<p>Are you a quantitative market researcher looking for a change of direction? Here is an opportunity to join the supplier side, in software.</p>
<p>We have a growing product and user base and need an organized, detail-oriented person to join our customer support team for our online data analysis and reporting app: Crunch.io.</p>
<p>You will be supporting market researchers around the world who use our rapidly evolving, cutting-edge app for market research data analysis and reporting.</p>
<p>This is the perfect role for a market research analyst who is highly technical and enjoys helping others.</p>
<p><strong>The role of the Technical Customer Support Engineer is centered around 4 key areas</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Customer support</strong> - triage and resolve highly complex, technical, and application-related support issues which impact product performance and customer success.</li>
<li><strong>Product testing</strong> - test our new product features, systematically and with attention to detail, detecting back bugs and contributing to new documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Supporting the sales team</strong> - review prospects data and prepare datasets for demonstration. Proactively assist new users with post-sales education and onboarding.</li>
<li><strong>Professional services</strong> - manage and execute specific projects where Crunch.io has been engaged to set up customer data on their behalf.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What you’ll do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a deep understanding of the application and internal Crunch documentation, becoming a Crunch expert.
Communicate with customers via email and online web calls (e.g. Zoom) to ensure effective use of our app in line with best-practice.</li>
<li>Maintain excellent relationships with customers by applying superb customer service and technical skills.</li>
<li>Field user questions, report problems and triage them appropriately in our centralized international support desk using the Zendesk app.</li>
<li>Develop and deliver reports on customer account usage on a periodic basis.</li>
<li>Apply in-depth troubleshooting and debugging skills to get to the root cause of customers’ issues. Develop clear reproduction steps for issues, for both problem-solving and acceptance testing. This involves integrating knowledge of different survey systems, the Crunch.io platform and other related software.</li>
<li>Prioritize customer cases effectively. It’s vital that you are able to juggle priorities, and articulate your plans to your co-workers and management.</li>
<li>Escalate the relevant support issues to product management and engineering teams. Our technical support staff need to be fully versed in our software to comprehensively close the majority of tickets independently.</li>
<li>Contribute to the knowledge base (help.crunch.io) and ensure that our documentation is up-to-date and accessible. This includes extensively researching and documenting software and technical issues, which can become the basis for knowledge base articles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basic qualifications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience &amp; Background. Experience in quantitative market research, with hands-on data manipulation. You have a background in market research operations, good understanding of survey analysis concepts, tools, and methods, and competency in a statistical programming language (eg: SPSS syntax or R). You need experience working with analysis software (eg: SPSS or R or Q), not just working from tabs.</li>
<li>Education. BA/BS degree in Computer Science and/or statistics preferred but other technical or quantitative degrees or equivalent work experience will also be considered.</li>
<li>Problem Solver. You are a natural problem solver with a curiosity about technology. Others describe you as a highly creative, curious technologist, and you have excellent research skills, and strong analytical and deductive skills, important for isolating the cause of bugs.</li>
<li>Communicator. Your verbal and written skills are top notch. You have excellent spoken and written English language skills. You will primarily be communicating with users in the United States and United Kingdom. You have an outstanding ability to empathize with customers and convey confidence, and are skilled with conflict resolution, collaboration and small group facilitation skills.</li>
<li>Organized. You must be able to juggle and prioritize a high volume workload and handle details accurately and in a timely manner under pressure.</li>
<li>Flexible. You have the ability to multitask and handle frequent interruptions.</li>
<li>Detail oriented.  Attention to detail is your trademark with a strong desire to find solutions for problems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remote working</strong></p>
<p>We are a remote company, with all employees working remotely. We believe in hiring the best people, not restricted by geography. For this role, we need flexibility in time zone coverage (eg: may encompass coverage of US &amp; European time zones for support). Working remotely requires high motivation and the ability to report back on productivity.  We also believe that it fosters an excellent work/life balance for our employees.</p>
<p><strong>Employee benefits</strong></p>
<p>We are a startup, with a fast paced startup culture. We are funded by and operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of a public company, so our employees benefit from the excellent benefits and opportunities provided by a large company.</p>

<p>We are hiring a Python Developer to help develop our platform. We are inviting you to join our small, fully remote team of developers and operators helping make our platform faster, more secure, and more reliable. You would help us deliver new features and build the future for how we deploy our products faster and safer while increasing the availability and reliability of our systems.

<p>We are looking for someone who is a quick study, who is eager to learn and grow with us, and who has experience in Agile cultures. At Crunch, we believe in learning together: we recognize that we don’t have all the answers, and we try to ask each other the right questions. Some of the ways that we accomplish that include paired programming to tackle a hard problem, transparent code reviews, and discussions about design and architecture. Since Crunch’s employees are completely distributed, it’s crucial that you can work well independently, and keep yourself motivated and focused. We move fast but carefully, with an earnest commitment to not breaking things… well, not too much.</p>

We deploy to Auto Scaling Groups using Ansible and Cloud-Init.</p>
<p><strong>What you&rsquo;ll do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Develop performance enhancements and new features in Crunch&rsquo;s proprietary Python in-memory database.</li>
<li>Work closely with product managers, sales, and customer success team to understand the system’s functional and non-functional requirements.</li>
<li>Establish realistic estimates for timelines and ensure that project remains on target to meet deadlines.</li>
<li>Contribute to code quality through unit testing, integration testing, code review, and system design using Python.</li>
<li>Assist in diagnosing and fixing system failures quickly when they occur in your area of expertise. This is limited to when the on-call rotation needs a subject matter expert to help troubleshoot an issue.</li>
<li>Design and implement RESTful API endpoints using the Python programming language.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basic qualifications</strong></p>
