      <description>A wealth of information can be locked in text data. Our new “sentiment analysis” feature enables you to quantify and analyze just a bit of it: whether the text in question is on balance Positive, Neutral, or Negative — and then crosstab the derived sentiment variable just like any other variable to understand the variations among other groups in the dataset.
In the properties panel for text variables, you’ll notice the Classify button.</description>

      <description>Lately we’ve been focusing on ways to make it easier for data owners to manage data for their clients. After all, Crunch isn’t just for analyzing data, it’s a tool for making everything about delivering data to clients faster, smoother, and more powerful.

      <title>Using Travis-CI to Build Static Sites</title>

      <description>At Crunch.io, we&amp;rsquo;re fervent believers in automation. If something requires a human to remember to do an extra manual step, it won&amp;rsquo;t happen consistently. We automate test running so that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to fix the same bug twice. We write code to do tedious tasks so that we can devote our mental energy to harder problems. We automate processes and policies so that developers don&amp;rsquo;t have remember the right things to do—the build and continuous-integration systems guide us.</description>

      <description>We first released the tab book feature a while back, and since then, we’ve collected a number of great suggestions for how to enrich the feature. Tab books produce a static set of tables out of many variables and put results in an Excel sheet, for offline use when you don’t need interactive features like new filters or different weights. Our recent release includes several of those enhancements, most of which are new options available to you in the “export tab book” panel.</description>

      <description>Crunch is seeking talented, motivated front-end engineers to build our interactive data applications. You would work with the rest of our team to help build a product that is changing the way our clients do their work. Both technical and aesthetic details matter greatly to you. (You like to use both arrow functions and en-dashes appropriately.) You want to surround yourself with talented peers who share your dedication. In short, you write solid, thoroughly tested, and readable code.</description>

You should be passionate about creating great user experiences and always advocate for them. We are looking for people who lives in the intersection of design and coding. You enjoy turning conceptual ideas into sketches or wireframes using a visual editor but also love to bring those designs to the web using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.</description>
