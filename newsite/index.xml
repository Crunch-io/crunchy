      <title>Subtotals for Categorical Data</title>

      <guid>https://crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/subtotals/</guid>
      <description>At Crunch, we are constantly searching for ways to help our customers&amp;mdash;and their clients&amp;mdash;gain insights from their data. A common task in the market-research world is to take data that is essentially a scale&amp;mdash;rate from 1 to 10, or an ordinal range of responses from &amp;ldquo;Strongly agree&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Strongly disagree&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and collapse it into a smaller number of bins. For example, if you asked people to rate their preference on a scale of 1-10 you might want to see how the people who provide a rating between 1 and 5 compare to those who rated it between 6 and 10.</description>

      <title>Introducing Dashboards</title>
      <link>https://crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/dataset-dashboard/</link>

      <guid>https://crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/dataset-dashboard/</guid>
      <description>Crunch is designed to make data accessible to many different audiences that have varying needs, expectations, and technical abilities. Our browse and analyze views allow data owners and analysts to quickly explore and analyze interesting insights in potentially large, complex datasets. However, not everyone has time to explore a dataset&amp;mdash;some need to see key findings at a glance.
To meet this executive-type need, we&amp;rsquo;re introducing a new dashboard feature.</description>

      <guid>https://crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/blog/nightwatch-selenium-docker/</guid>
      <description>At Crunch we greatly value tests. We have unit tests, functional tests, and the stack wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be complete without end-to-end tests. Good tests allow us to update code quickly and confidently.
For our end-to-end testing we use Nightwatch.js, a JavaScript testing tool that uses Selenium to drive a browser to perform tests. Our goal is to be able to test our Python backend, our REST APIs, and the behavior of our JavaScript single-page application, using a real browser, running real code.</description>

      <description>Crunch is designed to make it easy to manage and explore data, and it is particularly optimized for survey data.

And the kinds of analyses and reports that are standard among researchers are easily selected and exported.
These features are great if you work at a research company, or in a marketing department, or otherwise work with surveys professionally.</description>

      <description>A wealth of information can be locked in text data. Our new “sentiment analysis” feature enables you to quantify and analyze just a bit of it: whether the text in question is on balance Positive, Neutral, or Negative — and then crosstab the derived sentiment variable just like any other variable to understand the variations among other groups in the dataset.
In the properties panel for text variables, you’ll notice the Classify button.</description>

      <description>Lately we’ve been focusing on ways to make it easier for data owners to manage data for their clients. After all, Crunch isn’t just for analyzing data, it’s a tool for making everything about delivering data to clients faster, smoother, and more powerful.
To that end, we’ve recently developed a draft and publish feature that allows data owners to make significant changes to data accessible to their clients with minimal interruption to how those clients interact with the data.</description>

      <title>Using Travis-CI to Build Static Sites</title>

      <description>At Crunch.io, we&amp;rsquo;re fervent believers in automation. If something requires a human to remember to do an extra manual step, it won&amp;rsquo;t happen consistently. We automate test running so that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to fix the same bug twice. We write code to do tedious tasks so that we can devote our mental energy to harder problems. We automate processes and policies so that developers don&amp;rsquo;t have remember the right things to do—the build and continuous-integration systems guide us.</description>

      <title>Tab Book Improvements</title>

      <description>We first released the tab book feature a while back, and since then, we’ve collected a number of great suggestions for how to enrich the feature. Tab books produce a static set of tables out of many variables and put results in an Excel sheet, for offline use when you don’t need interactive features like new filters or different weights. Our recent release includes several of those enhancements, most of which are new options available to you in the “export tab book” panel.</description>
