      <title>Add subtotals (a.k.a. &#34;nets&#34;) to your multiple response variables</title>
      <link>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/subtotals-mr/</link>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/subtotals-mr/</guid>
      <description>Dataset editors have been able to add subtotals (a.k.a. “nets”) to categorical and categorical array variables for a long time, but this hasn’t been the case for multiple response variables. There are many applications for subtotals on multiple response variables — a common one is a group of products or sub-brands within a brand, or a grouping of statements into themes. Previously, users had to define new variables with often complex logic to describe each combination, and then hide the input variable.</description>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/subtotal-differences/</guid>
      <description>You’ve been able to create subtotals in Crunch for a long time, and they’re great for quickly seeing what proportion of respondents hold similar views, such as any level of agreement with a statement or any level of liking of a brand etc. But sometimes you also need to take into account the strength of opposing views — those who disagree or those who dislike, and for that you want to sum those who agree and take away the sum of those who disagree, leaving you with an overall measure you can use for simple comparisons.</description>

      <title>Great new visualizations for time-series analyses and trackers</title>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/new-time-plots/</guid>
      <description>Line graphs are great at showing how values are changing over time and therefore ideal for tracking studies. Crunch&amp;rsquo;s line graphs have been completely redesigned to offer some great new features as well as improved usability and flexibility.
Category selection
Line graphs become really hard to read when there are lots of lines shown simultaneously, so Crunch now defaults to showing just the top 5, but you can pick whichever combination of lines (including showing more or fewer than 5) from the new &amp;ldquo;Select categories&amp;rdquo; interface.</description>

      <title>Crunch Automation: A blueprint for building a solid home for your data</title>
      <link>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/blog/automation/crunch-automation/</link>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/blog/automation/crunch-automation/</guid>
      <description>Crunch Automation serves as a declarative history of transformations that have been done to a dataset. This is important to understand, because it informs you how you go about writing, running, editing and replicating datasets.
With SPSS syntax, it
 directly manipulates an SPSS datafile (eg: .sav file) is not designed with survey analysis in mind doesn’t set up derivations like Crunch does (it hard-codes anything you do as a new variable) doesn’t stay with the datafile (you keep your syntax separate from the datafile), and, importantly, alters your variables by overwriting the already-hard-coded variables with more syntax (which you can do endlessly)  Crunch Automation is the opposite in these respects.</description>

      <description>The sharing options for a dataset have been simplified and consolidated. Previously, both Share and Members links were visible to Dataset Editors. To simplify, Dataset Editors can only now see the Members link. The Share link option for Dataset Editors has been removed.
For Dataset Viewers, the sharing option with Share link has not changed.
Below we have outlined how you can share a dataset for different permission levels: Editors and Viewers.</description>

      <description>By using the new options panel revealed by clicking the three-dots icon in the display controller, users can choose which of these figures to display in the tooltip for table cells. The default statistics shown are the margin of error and unweighted base. Your chosen cell details are persisted as a user preference. For margin of error, you can also specify the number of decimal places you want to see.</description>

      <title>Greater flexibility to customize exports of tables from decks and dashboards</title>
      <link>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/customize-export-settings/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2021 15:00:10 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/customize-export-settings/</guid>
      <description>Back in September, we added a variety of advanced calculations to include in tab books (exported multitables) and other options to customize the exported tables. We&amp;rsquo;ve now added these same customization options to tables saved to (and exported from) the deck.
This can be helpful if you need to:
  Show more than one measure (percentages, counts, indices, Z-scores, population estimates) at once, or
  Have additional elements or measures included in your exports, such as pairwise comparison letters (ABCD), standard deviations, standard errors, etc.</description>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/trend-analysis/</guid>
      <description>In time series analysis, we want to be able to identify trends. As we collect data, random fluctuations can obfuscate a trend. Smoothing is an analytic process whereby we ‘iron out’ differences between time periods by taking the average of previous periods. This is also known as a moving average. You can now apply smoothing to your analyses with just a few clicks. In the smoothing tab accessed by clicking ⋮ select ‘One-sided moving average’ and choose the number of periods to ‘look back’ at each point.</description>

      <description>You can now choose a variety of advanced calculations to include in tab books (exported multitables) and other options to customize the exported tables. Table cells can now contain estimates of standard deviation and standard error, and column summaries can include the median of numeric values as well as the standard deviation for the column and standard error of the mean. Pairwise column significance tests can be conducted at the standard 0.</description>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/selective-tab-exports/</guid>
      <description>Exporting from dashboards just got more flexible. Instead of always having to export the whole dashboard, users are now able to choose between exporting the whole dashboard (still the default), exporting the currently viewed tab, or choosing a custom selection of one or more tabs to export.
The new, simplified “Export…” option opens the new Export panel which gives the choice of PowerPoint or Excel formats, but for dashboards with tabs, it also now contains a “Tabs” control.</description>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/multiple-selections-in-groups/</guid>
      <description>The Groups on dashboards can now optionally allow multiple category selections to effectively combine categories in the filter. Dashboard editors can set an option on the configuration screen for dashboard “Groups” that allows users to make multiple selections within each variable. For example, if you choose an age categories variable as a group and turn on this new option, the dashboard users will be able to select both “18–24” and “25–34” simultaneously, thereby creating a filter that includes anyone aged 18–34.</description>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/new-multiple-response-cat-array-builder/</guid>
      <description>Array variables allow you to analyze together a set of variables that share a common structure and theme. For example, surveys often ask respondents to use a common scale to rate or respond to different prompts, sometimes in a grid, all sharing a common set of response categories. When analyzing the data, a categorical array variable lets users see all the items together. This structure allows users to easily compare lists of brands against a common set of attributes, or compare a set of statements against a common agreement scale — something that is much harder to do with distinct categorical variables.</description>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/color-palettes/</guid>
      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been possible for some time to set custom colors for saved analyses in Crunch, but it&amp;rsquo;s been necessary to do this on a one-by-one basis which can be laborious and open to inconsistency. We now offer the ability to create custom color palettes, defined at the organization level, at folder levels, or both, which apply your chosen colors to newly created analyses as well as offering alternatives (e.g. for scales) that can be applied easily, as needed for particular analyses.</description>

      <description>When you create an analysis, you may need to edit it further for a PowerPoint export: for example, perhaps you want to hide &amp;lsquo;Not sure&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Prefer not to answer&amp;rsquo; categories, rename long labels, re-order the categories, give the whole analysis a descriptive title, or even simply change the coloring. You can now make these adjustments and more, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find all of those changes reflected in your PowerPoint and Excel exports.</description>

      <description>Users can now decide whether to show value labels for graphs and charts, both in Tables &amp;amp; Graphs mode and on dashboards. Value labels are these small numbers on graphs that show you the value represented by that bar/column/segment&amp;hellip;
 With the new feature turned on, these value labels will be displayed on all graphs you create. With the feature turned off (the default), the user needs to hover over a chart element to see a tool-tip with this value.</description>

      <description>Dashboards can now contain KPI analyses that take a single value from a table and present it in a tile. Great for when there&amp;rsquo;s a key metric you want to highlight or track.
 Dataset editors can now add KPI analyses like these to dashboards. This allows you to show a key company metric – e.g. Brand Awareness – as a prominent value that grabs attention.
To create one, simply save an analysis of any kind – table, chart or variable card – that contains the value you want to show as a KPI.</description>

      <description>To look in detail at your data, you sometimes need to create a variable that is the interaction of other categorical variables. You want to know not just how results differ between age groups or education level, but by age × education. The Crunch application lets you do this in just a few clicks by selecting the variables to interact — give the result a name (or accept the default of ‘x by y’) and you’re set.</description>

      <description>What are Crunch dashboards? A dashboard is a special view of your data that has been prepared with pre-made analyses — tables and graphs — designed to highlight key points for instant insight. Dashboards are great for conveying key information, drawn from your data, for users who don’t have the time (or the inclination) to do their own analysis. Crunch dashboards allow you to combine your important findings into a single display, perfect for sharing with colleagues and other end users.</description>

 Export this table – instantly grab an XLSX file of just what you see on screen, using whatever display settings you have currently selected. Export this table (saved settings) – instantly grab an XLSX file of the table that you see on screen but with whatever settings you’ve chosen in the Export tab book &amp;gt; Customize panel.</description>

      <description>Dataset folders allow you to organize your data hierarchically, similar to a file system as you might see in Windows Explorer or MacOS Finder. Folders make finding, organizing, and sharing data more intuitive.
  Folders can be used to organize large collections of datasets into more manageable units. If your organization imports data from many sources or has a large archive of previously imported data, you can organize them by source, time of import/survey, subject, etc.</description>

      <description>We know that for many, PowerPoint slides remain central to delivering results and to paraphrase Mark Twain, &amp;ldquo;reports of PowerPoint&amp;rsquo;s death have been greatly exagerated&amp;rdquo;. Crunch has long offered exports of analyses and tab books to Excel files, which, in addition to their own value, enabled people to get results from Crunch to PowerPoint by copying a cell range from Excel into a slide. That’s a bit tedious, though, and we wanted to do better, which is why we are excited to announce that PowerPoint exports from Crunch are now available if you have ‘Early access’ enabled in the app.</description>

      <description>At Crunch, one of the ways we try to make data exploration simple is by providing sensible default views that take into account the properties of your data and metadata. We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of releasing some plotting methods in our crplyr R package that define methods for ggplot2&amp;rsquo;s autoplot() function. autoplot() was the ideal approach for us to encapsulate the logic of how to &amp;ldquo;just do the right thing.&amp;rdquo; You can do the analysis you want, and it will make smart choices about how to display it with no additional input&amp;ndash;all of which you can control or override with additional ggplot2 layers, if you want.</description>

      <description>At Crunch, we are constantly searching for ways to help our customers&amp;mdash;and their clients&amp;mdash;gain insights from their data. A common task in the market-research world is to take data that is essentially a scale&amp;mdash;rate from 1 to 10, or an ordinal range of responses from &amp;ldquo;Strongly agree&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Strongly disagree&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and collapse it into a smaller number of bins. For example, if you asked people to rate their preference on a scale of 1-10 you might want to see how the people who provide a rating between 1 and 5 compare to those who rated it between 6 and 10.</description>

      <title>Introducing Dashboards</title>
      <link>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/dataset-dashboard/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2017 23:20:47 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/dataset-dashboard/</guid>
      <description>Crunch is designed to make data accessible to many different audiences that have varying needs, expectations, and technical abilities. Our browse and analyze views allow data owners and analysts to quickly explore and analyze interesting insights in potentially large, complex datasets. However, not everyone has time to explore a dataset&amp;mdash;some need to see key findings at a glance.
To meet this executive-type need, we&amp;rsquo;re introducing a new dashboard feature.
 This dashboard provides a quick view of up to four analyses, right when you open a dataset.</description>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/blog/nightwatch-selenium-docker/</guid>
      <description>At Crunch we greatly value tests. We have unit tests, functional tests, and the stack wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be complete without end-to-end tests. Good tests allow us to update code quickly and confidently.
For our end-to-end testing we use Nightwatch.js, a JavaScript testing tool that uses Selenium to drive a browser to perform tests. Our goal is to be able to test our Python backend, our REST APIs, and the behavior of our JavaScript single-page application, using a real browser, running real code.</description>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/blog/devs-as-users/</guid>
      <description>Crunch is designed to make it easy to manage and explore data, and it is particularly optimized for survey data. We natively support data types that are common in survey research, and it is also simple to do things like generate population weights and apply them automatically to all calculations. And the kinds of analyses and reports that are standard among researchers are easily selected and exported.
These features are great if you work at a research company, or in a marketing department, or otherwise work with surveys professionally.</description>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/r-package-1-18-0/</guid>
      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve just released version 1.18.0 of the Crunch R package. Current package users should see a message when they load the package instructing you how to update to the latest version. New users (or anyone) can install this latest release from CRAN with
install.packages(&amp;quot;crunch&amp;quot;)  See the package website for further instructions.

      <description>A wealth of information can be locked in text data. Our new “sentiment analysis” feature enables you to quantify and analyze just a bit of it: whether the text in question is on balance Positive, Neutral, or Negative — and then crosstab the derived sentiment variable just like any other variable to understand the variations among other groups in the dataset.
In the properties panel for text variables, you’ll notice the Classify button.</description>

      <description>Search has been a part of Crunch from the beginning. In a system designed to house and share large volumes of data, the ability to quickly find the data that&amp;rsquo;s important right now is critical. We&amp;rsquo;re continually working to improve how data is indexed to make searching faster and more accurate, and we just added a couple new ways for you to refine your searches to get to what you are looking for faster and more easily.</description>

      <description>We’ve been working on updating and improving the look of Crunch, and we wanted to take moment to call out a few of the recent improvements.
Let’s start at the top You may have noticed that we recently updated the Crunch header.
 This new top bar provides a more unified look throughout the application, and allows us to move user settings, dataset settings, and project settings into unobtrusive and consistently located dropdown menus.</description>

      <description>Lately we’ve been focusing on ways to make it easier for data owners to manage data for their clients. After all, Crunch isn’t just for analyzing data, it’s a tool for making everything about delivering data to clients faster, smoother, and more powerful.
To that end, we’ve recently developed a draft and publish feature that allows data owners to make significant changes to data accessible to their clients with minimal interruption to how those clients interact with the data.</description>

      <description>At Crunch.io, we&amp;rsquo;re fervent believers in automation. If something requires a human to remember to do an extra manual step, it won&amp;rsquo;t happen consistently. We automate test running so that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to fix the same bug twice. We write code to do tedious tasks so that we can devote our mental energy to harder problems. We automate processes and policies so that developers don&amp;rsquo;t have remember the right things to do—the build and continuous-integration systems guide us.</description>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/tab-book-improvements/</guid>
      <description>We first released the tab book feature a while back, and since then, we’ve collected a number of great suggestions for how to enrich the feature. Tab books produce a static set of tables out of many variables and put results in an Excel sheet, for offline use when you don’t need interactive features like new filters or different weights. Our recent release includes several of those enhancements, most of which are new options available to you in the “export tab book” panel.</description>
