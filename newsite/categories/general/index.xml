      <description>Crunch is designed to make it easy to manage and explore data, and it is particularly optimized for survey data. We natively support data types that are common in survey research, and it is also simple to do things like generate population weights and apply them automatically to all calculations. And the kinds of analyses and reports that are standard among researchers are easily selected and exported.
These features are great if you work at a research company, or in a marketing department, or otherwise work with surveys professionally.</description>

      <description>At Crunch.io, we&amp;rsquo;re fervent believers in automation. If something requires a human to remember to do an extra manual step, it won&amp;rsquo;t happen consistently. We automate test running so that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to fix the same bug twice. We write code to do tedious tasks so that we can devote our mental energy to harder problems. We automate processes and policies so that developers don&amp;rsquo;t have remember the right things to doâ€”the build and continuous-integration systems guide us.</description>
