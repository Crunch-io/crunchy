      <title>Sentiment Analysis</title>

      <description>A wealth of information can be locked in text data. Our new “sentiment analysis” feature enables you to quantify and analyze just a bit of it: whether the text in question is on balance Positive, Neutral, or Negative — and then crosstab the derived sentiment variable just like any other variable to understand the variations among other groups in the dataset.
In the properties panel for text variables, you’ll notice the Classify button.</description>

      <description>Search has been a part of Crunch from the beginning. In a system designed to house and share large volumes of data, the ability to quickly find the data that&amp;rsquo;s important right now is critical. We&amp;rsquo;re continually working to improve how data is indexed to make searching faster and more accurate, and we just added a couple new ways for you to refine your searches to get to what you are looking for faster and more easily.</description>

      <description>We’ve been working on updating and improving the look of Crunch, and we wanted to take moment to call out a few of the recent improvements.
Let’s start at the top You may have noticed that we recently updated the Crunch header.
 This new top bar provides a more unified look throughout the application, and allows us to move user settings, dataset settings, and project settings into unobtrusive and consistently located dropdown menus.</description>

      <description>Lately we’ve been focusing on ways to make it easier for data owners to manage data for their clients. After all, Crunch isn’t just for analyzing data, it’s a tool for making everything about delivering data to clients faster, smoother, and more powerful.
To that end, we’ve recently developed a draft and publish feature that allows data owners to make significant changes to data accessible to their clients with minimal interruption to how those clients interact with the data.</description>

      <title>Tab Book Improvements</title>
      <link>http://crunch.io/dev/features/tab-book-improvements/</link>

      <description>We first released the tab book feature a while back, and since then, we’ve collected a number of great suggestions for how to enrich the feature. Tab books produce a static set of tables out of many variables and put results in an Excel sheet, for offline use when you don’t need interactive features like new filters or different weights. Our recent release includes several of those enhancements, most of which are new options available to you in the “export tab book” panel.</description>
