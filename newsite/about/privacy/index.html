<ul>
<li>Legitimate interests; or</li>
<li>Consent</li>
</ul>
<p>Because marketing rules vary between countries, the legal ground for processing that we rely on will depend on your geographic location.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the grounds under which we process your personal data, or would like to find out more about the approach we take to determine that these grounds apply, please contact us using the contact details in the ‘How to contact us’ section.</p>
<h3 id="transferring-personal-data-outside-the-eea">Transferring personal data outside the EEA</h3>

<li>We use encryption to secure your personal data whilst it is in transit using TLS;</li>

<li>We make security the responsibility of all our employees and we train our staff to identify security risks and protect your data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our website may from time to time contain links to and from other websites.

<p>If you are a prospective client, we would like to send you marketing communications to tell you about our products and services, which could include information about industry insights, our Services and emails direct from our sales teams.
