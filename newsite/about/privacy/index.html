<p>We are committed to the lawful, fair and transparent use of personal data.

<ul>
<li>Legitimate interests; or</li>
<li>Consent</li>
</ul>
<p>Because marketing rules vary between countries, the legal ground for processing that we rely on will depend on your geographic location.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the grounds under which we process your personal data, or would like to find out more about the approach we take to determine that these grounds apply, please contact us using the contact details in the ‘How to contact us’ section.</p>

<li>We use encryption to secure your personal data whilst it is in transit using TLS;</li>
<li>We allow access to attributable data (by which we mean data that directly identifies you) only to those Crunch employees who need it to carry out their job responsibilities, for example our account management team to allow them to respond to you when you contact us;</li>
<li>We make security the responsibility of all our employees and we train our staff to identify security risks and protect your data.</li>
</ul>

We may also contact you about other services that we offer, and for these messages, we rely on our legitimate interest in running our business as the legal grounds for this processing.</p>
<p>If you are a prospective client, we would like to send you marketing communications to tell you about our products and services, which could include information about industry insights, our Services and emails direct from our sales teams.  Because marketing rules vary between countries, the legal ground for processing that we rely on will depend on your geographic location, however you will always be able to unsubscribe (either through your Account or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive).</p>
