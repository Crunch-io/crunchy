      <description>Line graphs are great at showing how values are changing over time and therefore ideal for tracking studies. Crunch&amp;rsquo;s line graphs have been completely redesigned to offer some great new features as well as improved usability and flexibility.
Category selection
Line graphs become really hard to read when there are lots of lines shown simultaneously, so Crunch now defaults to showing just the top 5, but you can pick whichever combination of lines (including showing more or fewer than 5) from the new &amp;ldquo;Select categories&amp;rdquo; interface.</description>
