      <description>Crunchâ€™s folders give you the power to organize your datasets and control access. Now folders can also be a great landing page for new and existing data consumers.
Folder Homepages can contain images, formatted text, embedded videos and links to other resources to provide Crunch customization, as well as to aide in navigation to other resources such as terms and conditions. You can tailor the experience for your teammates and clients when they arrive into Crunch.</description>
