      <description>Now dataset editors can access most dataset actions directly from the dataset menu. Additionally we’ve redesigned our dataset properties page.
New dataset menu
When you click the dataset name from within a dataset, you may notice some changes to the dropdown menu:
Many of the actions that used to be accessed through Dataset properties can now be performed directly from this menu. Specifically Export dataset, Append, Join, Organize variables, Exclude cases, and (under Advanced), Create draft and View dataset history.</description>

      <title>Fix categories to the bottom of lists when sorting</title>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/fix-categories-when-sorting/</guid>
      <description>We understand that when creating analyses for export or dashboards, certain answer categories carry different significance. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo;, “Other” and &amp;ldquo;None of these&amp;rdquo; are three such examples that often require special handling. With Crunch&amp;rsquo;s latest feature, you can now effortlessly fix these categories, or any others of your choosing, to the end of your lists when sorting, ensuring that they are sensibly placed at the end and not merged in amongst your brand lists, attitude statements, etc.</description>

      <description>We’re excited to share the newest update to dataset folder navigation. We’ve added a tree view of the folders shared with you to the left side of the “all datasets” page, so you can browse and move more easily between subfolders.
Editors and administrators can use the sidebar to organize folders and subfolders by dragging and dropping. Viewers can see the organization of any folder trees shared with them and navigate between different folders and subfolders they have access to.</description>

      <description>Dataset Views: Quickly Create, Deliver, and Share Data Subsets
It’s increasingly common to collect data for multiple clients or multiple groups of stakeholders in one single survey. Whether for an Omnibus product, a syndicated data product or simply different regional groupings, it can be challenging to meet the different data needs of these client and stakeholder groups with a single dataset. To meet this need, Crunch has developed Dataset Views.</description>

      <description>Crunch’s folders give you the power to organize your datasets and control access. Now folders can also be a great landing page for new and existing data consumers.
Folder Homepages can contain images, formatted text, embedded videos and links to other resources to provide Crunch customization, as well as to aide in navigation to other resources such as terms and conditions. You can tailor the experience for your teammates and clients when they arrive into Crunch.</description>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/dataset-sharing/</guid>
      <description>The sharing options for a dataset have been simplified and consolidated. Previously, both Share and Members links were visible to Dataset Editors. To simplify, Dataset Editors can only now see the Members link. The Share link option for Dataset Editors has been removed.
For Dataset Viewers, the sharing option with Share link has not changed.
Below we have outlined how you can share a dataset for different permission levels: Editors and Viewers.</description>

      <title>Improved Organization of Datasets</title>
      <link>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/dataset-folders/</link>

      <guid>//crunch-io.github.io/crunchy/newsite/dev/features/dataset-folders/</guid>
      <description>Dataset folders allow you to organize your data hierarchically, similar to a file system as you might see in Windows Explorer or MacOS Finder. Folders make finding, organizing, and sharing data more intuitive.
Folders can be used to organize large collections of datasets into more manageable units. If your organization imports data from many sources or has a large archive of previously imported data, you can organize them by source, time of import/survey, subject, etc.</description>
