      <description>The sharing options for a dataset have been simplified and consolidated. Previously, both Share and Members links were visible to Dataset Editors. To simplify, Dataset Editors can only now see the Members link. The Share link option for Dataset Editors has been removed.
For Dataset Viewers, the sharing option with Share link has not changed.
Below we have outlined how you can share a dataset for different permission levels: Editors and Viewers.</description>

      <description>Dataset folders allow you to organize your data hierarchically, similar to a file system as you might see in Windows Explorer or MacOS Finder. Folders make finding, organizing, and sharing data more intuitive.
  Folders can be used to organize large collections of datasets into more manageable units. If your organization imports data from many sources or has a large archive of previously imported data, you can organize them by source, time of import/survey, subject, etc.</description>
