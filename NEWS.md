### crunchy 0.2.3 (under development)
* Support for all `shiny::bootstrapPage()` types directly: no need for a `crunch-`prefixed version of them. Now you can use `navbarPage`, `fillPage`, etc. just as you would for any `shiny` app, and when the `crunchy` package is loaded, Crunch authentication and other enhancements will automatically be loaded.

### crunchy 0.2.2

* `crunchNavbarPage` for Crunchy version of `navbarPage` (#2)

## crunchy 0.2.0

* `crunchFillPage` for flexbox version of `crunchPage`
* CSS tweaks to improve scrolling and better display Plotly graphics

## crunchy 0.1.0

* Initial addition of functions and tests
